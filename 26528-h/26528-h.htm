<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>GOLIAH AND THE PURPLE LID</h3>
</div>

<p>One of my highbrow reg&#8217;lars at the
Physical Culture Studio, a gent that
mixes up in charity works, like organizin&#8217;
debatin&#8217; societies in the deaf and dumb
asylums, was tellin&#8217; me awhile back of a great
scheme of his to help out the stranger in our
fair village. He wants to open public information
bureaus, where a jay might go and find out
anything he wanted to know, from how to locate
a New Thought church, to the nearest place
where he could buy a fresh celluloid collar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get the idea?&#8221; says he. &#8220;A public
bureau where strangers in New York would be
given courteous attention, friendly advice, and
that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t I here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Course, I was just gettin&#8217; over a josh. But
say, it ain&#8217;t all a funny dream, either. Don&#8217;t a
lot of &#8217;em come my way? Maybe it&#8217;s because
I&#8217;m so apt to lay myself open to the confidential
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
tackle. But somehow, when I see one of these
tourist freaks sizin&#8217; me up, and lookin&#8217; kind of
dazed and lonesome, I can&#8217;t chuck him back the
frosty stare. I&#8217;ve been a stray in a strange
town myself. So I gen&#8217;rally tries to seem halfway
human, and if he opens up with some shot
on the weather, I let him get in the follow-up
questions and take the chances.</p>
<p>Here the other day, though, I wa&#8217;n&#8217;t lookin&#8217;
for anything of the kind. I was just joltin&#8217;
down my luncheon with a little promenade up
the sunny side of Avenue V, taking in the exhibits&mdash;things
in the show windows and folks
on the sidewalks&mdash;as keen as if I&#8217;d paid in my
dollar at some ticket office.</p>
<p>And say, where can you beat it? I see it
&#8217;most every day in the year, and it&#8217;s always
new. There&#8217;s different flowers in the florists&#8217;
displays, new flags hung out on the big hotels,
and even the chorus ladies in the limousines are
changed now and then.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t figure out just what it was landed me
in front of this millinery window. Gen&#8217;rally
I hurry by them exhibits with a shudder; for
once I got gay and told Sadie to take her pick,
as this one was on me; and it was months before
I got over the shock of payin&#8217; that bill.
But there I finds myself, close up to the plate
glass, gawpin&#8217; at a sample of what can be done
in the hat line when the Bureau of Obstructions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
has been bought off and nobody&#8217;s thought of
applyin&#8217; the statute of limitations.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a heliotrope lid, and the foundation must
have used up enough straw to bed down a circus.
It has the dimensions and general outlines of a
summerhouse. The scheme of decoration is
simple enough, though. The top of this heliotrope
summerhouse has been caught in a heliotrope
fog, that&#8217;s all. There&#8217;s yards and yards
of this gauzy stuff draped and puffed and looped
around it, with only a wide purple ribbon
showin&#8217; here and there and keepin&#8217; the fog in
place.</p>
<p>Well, all that is restin&#8217; careless in a box, the
size of a quarter-mile runnin&#8217; track, with the
cover half off. And it&#8217;s a work of art in itself,
that box,&mdash;all Looey Cans pictures, and a thick
purple silk cord to tie it up with. Why, one
glimpse of that combination was enough to
make me clap my hand over my roll and back
away from the spot!</p>
<p>Just then, though, I notices another gent steppin&#8217;
up for a squint at the monstrosity, and I
can&#8217;t help lingerin&#8217; to see if he gets the same
kind of a shock. He&#8217;s sort of a queer party,
too,&mdash;short, stoop shouldered, thin faced,
wrinkled old chap, with a sandy mustache
mixed some with gray, and a pair of shrewd little
eyes peerin&#8217; out under bushy brows. Anybody
could spot him as a rutabaga delegate by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
the high crowned soft hat and the back number
ulster that he&#8217;s still stickin&#8217; to, though the thermometer
is way up in the eighties.</p>
<p>But he don&#8217;t seem to shy any at the purple
lid. He sticks his head out first this way and
then that, like a turtle, and then all of a sudden
he shoots over kind of a quizzin&#8217; glance at me.
I can&#8217;t help but give him the grin. At that his
mouth corners wrinkle up and the little gray
eyes begin to twinkle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a hat, eh?&#8221; he chuckles.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s goin&#8217; some in the lid line,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect that&#8217;s a mighty stylish article,
though,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the bluff the store people are
makin&#8217;,&#8221; says I, &#8220;and there&#8217;s no law against
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would be your guess on the price of
that there, now?&#8221; says he, edging up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, let&#8217;s leave such harrowin&#8217; details to the
man that has to pay for it,&#8221; says I. &#8220;No use
in our gettin&#8217; the chilly spine over what&#8217;s
marked on the price ticket; that is, unless you&#8217;re
thinking of investin&#8217;,&#8221; and as I tips him the
humorous wink I starts to move off.</p>
<p>But this wa&#8217;n&#8217;t a case where I was to get
out so easy. He comes right after me. &#8220;Excuse
me, neighbor,&#8221; says he; &#8220;but&mdash;but that&#8217;s
exactly what I was thinking of doing, if it wasn&#8217;t
too infernally expensive.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; says I, gazin&#8217; at him; for he ain&#8217;t
the kind of citizen you&#8217;d expect to find indulgin&#8217;
in such foolishness. &#8220;Oh, well, don&#8217;t mind my
remarks. Go ahead and blow yourself. You
want it for the missus, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-e-es,&#8221; he drawls; &#8220;for&mdash;for my wife.
Ah&mdash;er&mdash;would it be asking too much of a
stranger if I should get you to step in there
with me while I find out the price?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; says I, lookin&#8217; him over careful,&mdash;&#8220;why,
I don&#8217;t know as I&#8217;d want to go as far
as&mdash;&mdash; Well, what&#8217;s the object?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I&#8217;m sort of a bashful
person,&mdash;always have been,&mdash;and I don&#8217;t just
like to go in there alone amongst all them women
folks. But the fact is, I&#8217;ve kind of got my
mind set on having that hat, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wife ain&#8217;t in town, then?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says he, &#8220;she&#8217;s&mdash;she isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you runnin&#8217; some risks,&#8221; says I,
&#8220;loadin&#8217; up with a lid that may not fit her
partic&#8217;lar style of beauty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, that&#8217;s so,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Ought
to be something that would kind of jibe with her
complexion and the color of her hair, hadn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve surrounded the idea,&#8221; says I.
&#8220;Maybe it would be safer to send for her to
come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says he; &#8220;couldn&#8217;t be done. But see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
here,&#8221; and he takes my arm and steers me up
the avenue, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t mind talking this
over, I&#8217;d like to tell you a plan I&#8217;ve just thought
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, he&#8217;d got me some int&#8217;rested in him by
that time. I could see he wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no common
Rube, and them twinklin&#8217; little eyes of his kind
of got me. So I tells him to reel it off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you never heard of me,&#8221; he goes on;
&#8220;but I&#8217;m Goliah Daggett, from South Forks,
Iowy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ve missed hearin&#8217; of you,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; says he, kind of disappointed,
though. &#8220;The boys out there call me
Gol Daggett.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds most like a cussword,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; says he; &#8220;that&#8217;s one reason I&#8217;m
pretty well known in the State. And there may
be other reasons, too.&#8221; He lets out a little
chuckle at that; not loud, you know, but just as
though he was swallowin&#8217; some joke or other.
It was a specialty of his, this smothered chuckle
business. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; he goes on, &#8220;you
needn&#8217;t tell me your name, unless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fair swap,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Mine&#8217;s McCabe;
Shorty for short.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; says he. &#8220;I knew a McCabe once.
He&mdash;er&mdash;well, he&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; says I. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big fam&#8217;ly,
and there&#8217;s only a few of us that&#8217;s real credits
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
to the name. But about this scheme of yours,
Mr. Daggett?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; says he. &#8220;It&#8217;s just this: If I
could find a woman who looked a good deal like
my wife, I could try the hat on her, couldn&#8217;t I?
She&#8217;d do as well, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why not,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I know of just such a
woman; saw her this morning in my hotel barber
shop, where I dropped in for a haircut. She
was one of these&mdash;What do you call &#8217;em now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Manicure artists?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Asked me if I didn&#8217;t
want my fingers manicured; and, by jinks! I let
her do it, just to see what it was like. Never
felt so blamed foolish in my life! Look at
them fingernails, will you? Been parin&#8217; &#8217;em
with a jackknife for fifty-seven years; and she
soaks &#8217;em out in a bowl of perfumery, jabs under
&#8217;em with a little stick wrapped in cotton,
cuts off all the hang nails, files &#8217;em round at the
ends, and polishes &#8217;em up so they shine as if
they were varnished! He, he! Guess the boys
would laugh if they could have seen me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one experience you&#8217;ve got on me,&#8221;
says I. &#8220;And this manicure lady is a ringer
for Mrs. Daggett, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; says he, scratchin&#8217; his chin,
&#8220;maybe I ought to put it that she looks a good
deal as Mrs. Daggett might have looked ten or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
fifteen years ago if she&#8217;d been got up that way,&mdash;same
shade of red hair, only not such a thunderin&#8217;
lot of it; same kind of blue eyes, only not
so wide open and starry; and a nose and chin
that I couldn&#8217;t help remarking. Course, now,
you understand this young woman was fixed
up considerable smarter than Mrs. Daggett ever
was in her life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she&#8217;s a manicure artist in one of them
Broadway hotels,&#8221; says I, &#8220;I could guess that;
specially if Mrs. Daggett&#8217;s always stuck to
Iowa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right; she has,&#8221; says Daggett.
&#8220;But if she&#8217;d had the same chance to know
what to wear and how to wear it&mdash;&mdash;Well, I
wish she&#8217;d had it, that&#8217;s all. And she wanted
it. My, my! how she did hanker for such
things, Mr. McCabe!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, better late than never,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; says he, his voice kind of breakin&#8217;
up. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I want to forget, how&mdash;how
late it is!&#8221; and hanged if he don&#8217;t have to
fish out a handkerchief and swab off his eyes.
&#8220;You see,&#8221; he goes on, &#8220;Marthy&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I. &#8220;You mean she&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He nods. &#8220;Four years ago this spring,&#8221;
says he. &#8220;Typhoid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; says I, &#8220;how about this hat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of my notions,&#8221; says he,&mdash;&#8220;just a
foolish idea of mine. I&#8217;ll tell you. When she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
was lying there, all white and thin, and not
caring whether she ever got up again or not, a
new spring hat was the only thing I could get
her to take an interest in. She&#8217;d never had
what you might call a real, bang-up, stylish hat.
Always wanted one, too. And it wasn&#8217;t because
I was such a mean critter that she
couldn&#8217;t have had the money. But you know
how it is in a little place like South Forks. They
don&#8217;t have &#8217;em in stock, not the kind she wanted,
and maybe we couldn&#8217;t have found one nearer
than Omaha or Chicago; and someway there
never was a spring when I could seem to fix
things so we could take the trip. Looked kind
of foolish, too, traveling so far just to get a
hat. So she went without, and put up with what
Miss Simmons could trim for her. They looked
all right, too, and I used to tell Marthy they
were mighty becoming; but all the time I knew
they weren&#8217;t just&mdash;well, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Say, I never saw any specimens of Miss Simmons&#8217;
art works; but I could make a guess.
And I nods my head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says Daggett, &#8220;when I saw that
Marthy was kind of giving up, I used to coax
her to get well. &#8216;You just get on your feet
once, Marthy,&#8217; says I, &#8216;and we&#8217;ll go down to
Chicago and buy you the finest and stylishest
hat we can find in the whole city. More than
that, you shall have a new one every spring, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
very best.&#8217; She&#8217;d almost smile at that, and
half promise she&#8217;d try. But it wasn&#8217;t any use.
The fever hadn&#8217;t left her strength enough. And
the first thing I knew she&#8217;d slipped away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Odd sort of yarn to be hearin&#8217; there on Fifth-ave.
on a sunshiny afternoon, wa&#8217;n&#8217;t it? And
us dodgin&#8217; over crossin&#8217;s, and duckin&#8217; under
awnin&#8217;s, and sidesteppin&#8217; the foot traffic! But
he keeps right close to my elbow and gives me
the whole story, even to how they&#8217;d agreed to
use the little knoll just back of the farmhouse
as a burial plot, and how she marked the hymns
she wanted sung, and how she wanted him to
find someone else as soon as the year was out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which was the only thing I couldn&#8217;t say
yes to,&#8221; says Daggett. &#8220;&#8216;No, Marthy,&#8217; says I,
&#8216;not unless I can find another just like you.&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;You&#8217;ll
be mighty lonesome, Goliah,&#8217; says she,
&#8216;and you&#8217;ll be wanting to change your flannels
too early.&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;Maybe so,&#8217; says I; &#8216;but I guess
I&#8217;ll worry along for the rest of the time alone.&#8217;
Yes, sir, Mr. McCabe, she was a fine woman,
and a patient one. No one ever knew how bad
she wanted lots of things that she might of had,
and gave up. You see, I was pretty deep in the
wheat business, and every dollar I could get
hold of went to buying more reapers and interests
in elevator companies and crop options. I
was bound to be a rich man, and they say I got
there. Yes, I guess I am fairly well fixed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>It wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any chesty crow, but more like a
sigh, and as we stops on a crossing to let a lady
plutess roll by in her brougham, Mr. Daggett
he sizes up the costume she wore and shakes his
head kind of regretful.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way Marthy should have been
dressed,&#8221; says he. &#8220;She&#8217;d have liked it. And
she&#8217;d liked a hat such as that one we saw back
there; that is, if it&#8217;s the right kind. I&#8217;ve been
buying &#8217;em kind of careless, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; says he, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t finish telling you
about my fool idea. I&#8217;ve been getting one every
spring, the best I could pick out in Chicago, and
carrying it up there on the knoll where Marthy
is&mdash;and just leaving it. Go on now, Mr. McCabe;
laugh if you want to. I won&#8217;t mind. I
can almost laugh at myself. Of course,
Marthy&#8217;s beyond caring for hats now. Still, I
like to leave &#8217;em there; and I like to think perhaps
she does know, after all. So&mdash;so I want
to get that purple one, providing it would be
the right shade. What do you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Talk about your nutty propositions, eh? But
honest, I didn&#8217;t feel even like crackin&#8217; a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daggett,&#8221; says I, &#8220;you&#8217;re a true sport,
even if you have got a few bats in the loft.
Let&#8217;s go back and get quotations on the
lid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I could see it tried on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
that manicure young woman first. Suppose we
go down and bring her up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think she&#8217;ll come?&#8221;
says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess she will,&#8221; says he, quiet and
thoughtful. &#8220;We&#8217;ll try, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>And say, right there I got a new line on
him. I could almost frame up how it was he&#8217;d
started in as a bacon borrowin&#8217; homesteader,
and got to be the John D. of his county. But
I could see he was up against a new deal this
trip. And as it was time for me to be gettin&#8217;
down towards 42d-st. anyway, I goes along.
As we strikes the hotel barber shop I hangs up
on the end of the cigar counter while Daggett
looks around for the young woman who&#8217;d put
the chappy polish on his nails.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s her,&#8221; says he, pointing out a heavyweight
Titian blonde in the far corner, and over
he pikes.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help admirin&#8217; the nerve of him;
for of all the l&#8217;ongoline queens I ever saw, she&#8217;s
about the haughtiest. Maybe you can throw
on the screen a picture of a female party with a
Lillian Russell shape, hair like Mrs. Leslie Carter&#8217;s,
and an air like a twelve-dollar cloak model
showin&#8217; off a five hundred-dollar lace dress to
a bookmaker&#8217;s bride.</p>
<p>Just as Daggett tiptoes up she&#8217;s pattin&#8217; down
some of the red puffs that makes the back of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
her head look like a burnin&#8217; oil tank, and she
swings around languid and scornful to see who
it is that dares butt in on her presence. All the
way she recognizes him is by a little lift of the
eyebrows.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need to hear the dialogue. I can tell
by her expression what Daggett is saying. First
there&#8217;s a kind of condescendin&#8217; curiosity as he
begins, then she looks bored and turns back to
the mirror, and pretty soon she sings out,
&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; so you could hear her all over
the shop. Then Daggett springs his proposition
flat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir!&#8221; says she, jumpin&#8217; up and glarin&#8217; at
him.</p>
<p>Daggett tries to soothe her down; but it&#8217;s
no go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Heinmuller!&#8221; she calls out, and the
boss barber comes steppin&#8217; over, leavin&#8217; a customer
with his face muffled in a hot towel.
&#8220;This person,&#8221; she goes on, &#8220;is insulting!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey?&#8221; says Heinmuller, puffin&#8217; out his
cheeks. &#8220;Vos iss dot?&#8221;</p>
<p>And for a minute it looked like I&#8217;d have to
jump in and save Daggett from being chucked
through the window. I was just preparin&#8217; to
grab the boss by the collar, too, when Daggett
gets in his fine work. Slippin&#8217; a ten off his roll,
he passes it to Heinmuller, while he explains
that all he asked of the lady was to try
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
on a hat he was thinkin&#8217; of gettin&#8217; for his
wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; says he. &#8220;No insult intended.
And of course I expect to make it worth while
for the young lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether it was the smooth
&#8220;young lady&#8221; business, or the sight of the fat
roll that turned the trick; but the tragedy is
declared off. Inside of three minutes the boss
tells Daggett that Miss Rooney accepts his apology
and consents to go if he&#8217;ll call a cab.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, surely,&#8221; says he. &#8220;You&#8217;ll come
along, too, won&#8217;t you, McCabe? Honest, now,
I wouldn&#8217;t dare do this alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad about that shy, retirin&#8217; disposition
of yours!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Afraid she&#8217;ll steal you,
eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>But he hangs onto my sleeve and coaxes me
until I give in. And we sure made a fine trio
ridin&#8217; up Fifth-ave. in a taxi! But you should
have seen &#8217;em in the millinery shop as we sails
in with Miss Rooney, and Daggett says how
he&#8217;d like a view of that heliotrope lid in the
window. We had &#8217;em guessin&#8217;, all right.</p>
<p>Then they gets Miss Rooney in a chair before
the mirror, and fits the monstrosity on top of
her red hair. Well, say, what a diff&#8217;rence it
does make in them freak bonnets whether
they&#8217;re in a box or on the right head! For
Miss Rooney has got just the right kind of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
face that hat was built to go with. It&#8217;s a bit
giddy, I&#8217;ll admit; but she&#8217;s a stunner in it.
And does she notice it any herself? Well,
some!</p>
<p>&#8220;A triumph!&#8221; gurgles the saleslady, lookin&#8217;
from one to the other of us, tryin&#8217; to figure out
who she ought to play to.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a game combination, all right,&#8221; says I,
lookin&#8217; wise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wish&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; begins Daggett, and then
swallows the rest of it. In a minute he steps
up and says it&#8217;ll do, and that the young lady is
to pick out one for herself now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how perfectly sweet of you!&#8221; says
Miss Rooney, slippin&#8217; him a smile that should
have had him clear through the ropes. &#8220;But
if I am to have any, why not this?&#8221; and she
balances the heliotrope lid on her fingers, lookin&#8217;
it over yearnin&#8217; and tender. &#8220;It just suits me,
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s more of the coy business, aimed
straight at Daggett. But Miss Rooney don&#8217;t
quite put it across.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s going out to Iowy with me,&#8221; says
he, prompt and decided.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; says Miss Rooney, and she proceeds
to pick out a white straw with a green ostrich
feather a yard long. She was still lookin&#8217;
puzzled, though, as we put her into the cab and
started her back to the barber shop.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Must have set you back near a hundred,
didn&#8217;t they?&#8221; says I, as Daggett and I parts
on the corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost,&#8221; says he. &#8220;But it&#8217;s worth it.
Marthy would have looked mighty stylish in
that purple one. Yes, yes! And when I get
back to South Forks, the first thing I do will be
to carry it up on the knoll, box and all, and
leave it there. I wonder if she&#8217;ll know, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>There wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any use in my tellin&#8217; him what
I thought, though. He wa&#8217;n&#8217;t talkin&#8217; to me,
anyway. There was a kind of a far off, batty
look in his eyes as he stood there on the corner,
and a drop of brine was tricklin&#8217; down one side
of his nose. So we never says a word, but just
shakes hands, him goin&#8217; his way, and me mine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chee!&#8221; says Swifty Joe, when I shows up,
along about three o&#8217;clock, &#8220;you must have been
puttin&#8217; away a hearty lunch!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wa&#8217;n&#8217;t that kept me,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I was
helpin&#8217; hand a late one to Marthy.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>HOW MAIZIE CAME THROUGH</h3>
</div>

<p>Then again, there&#8217;s other kinds from other
States, and no two of &#8217;em alike. They float in
from all quarters, some on ten-day excursions,
and some with no return ticket. And, of course,
they&#8217;re all jokes to us at first, while we never
suspicion that all along we may be jokes to
them.</p>
<p>And say, between you and me, we&#8217;re apt to
think, ain&#8217;t we, that all the rapid motion in the
world gets its start right here in New York?
Well, that&#8217;s the wrong dope. For instance,
once I got next to a super-energized specimen
that come in from the north end of nowhere, and
before I was through the experience had left
me out of breath.</p>
<p>It was while Sadie and me was livin&#8217; at the
Perzazzer hotel, before we moved out to Rockhurst-on-the-Sound.
Early one evenin&#8217; we
was sittin&#8217;, as quiet and domestic as you please,
in our twelve by fourteen cabinet finished dinin&#8217;
room on the seventh floor. We was gazin&#8217; out
of the open windows watchin&#8217; a thunder storm
meander over towards Long Island, and Tidson
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
was just servin&#8217; the demitasses, when there&#8217;s
a ring on the &#8217;phone. Tidson, he puts down the
tray and answers the call.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from the office, sir,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Some
one to see you, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Get a description, Tidson,
so I&#8217;ll know what to expect.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that he asks the room clerk for details,
and reports that it&#8217;s two young ladies by the
name of Blickens.</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; says Sadie, prickin&#8217; up her ears.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t know any young women of that
name; do you, Shorty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; says I. &#8220;How can I tell until
I&#8217;ve looked &#8217;em over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; says she. &#8220;Blickens!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds nice, don&#8217;t it?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Kind of
snappy and interestin&#8217;. Maybe I&#8217;d better go
down and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tidson,&#8221; says Sadie, &#8220;tell them to send
those young persons up here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Tidson,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
mind anything I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blickens, indeed!&#8221; says Sadie, eyin&#8217; me
sharp, to see if I&#8217;m blushin&#8217; or gettin&#8217; nervous.
&#8220;I never heard you mention any such name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a few points about my past life,&#8221;
says I, &#8220;that I&#8217;ve had sense enough to keep
to myself. Maybe this is one. Course, if your
curiosity&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a bit curious, Shorty McCabe,&#8221; she
snaps out, &#8220;and you know it! But when it
comes to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Misses Blickens,&#8221; says Tidson, holdin&#8217;
back the draperies with one hand, and smotherin&#8217;
a grin with the other.</p>
<p>Say, you couldn&#8217;t blame him. What steps in
is a couple of drippy females that look like
they&#8217;d just been fished out of a tank. And bein&#8217;
wet wa&#8217;n&#8217;t the worst of it. Even if they&#8217;d been
dry, they must have looked bad enough; but in
the soggy state they was the limit.</p>
<p>They wa&#8217;n&#8217;t mates. One is tall and willowy,
while the other is short and dumpy. And the
fat one has the most peaceful face I ever saw
outside of a pasture, with a reg&#8217;lar Holstein-Friesian
set of eyes,&mdash;the round, calm, thoughtless
kind. The fact that she&#8217;s chewin&#8217; gum
helps out the dairy impression, too. It&#8217;s plain
she&#8217;s been caught in the shower and has sopped
up her full share of the rainfall; but it don&#8217;t
seem to trouble her any.</p>
<p>There ain&#8217;t anything pastoral about the tall
one, though. She&#8217;s alive all the way from her
runover heels to the wiggly end of the limp
feather that flops careless like over one ear.
She&#8217;s the long-waisted, giraffe-necked kind; but
not such a bad looker if you can forget the depressin&#8217;
costume. It had been a blue cheviot
once, I guess; the sort that takes on seven
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
shades of purple about the second season. And
it fits her like a damp tablecloth hung on a chair.
Her runnin&#8217; mate is all in black, and you could
tell by the puckered seams and the twisted
sleeves that it was an outfit the village dressmaker
had done her worst on.</p>
<p>Not that they gives us much chance for a
close size-up. The lengthy one pikes right into
the middle of the room, brushes a stringy lock
of hair off her face, and unlimbers her conversation
works.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh!&#8221; says she, openin&#8217; her eyes wide
and lookin&#8217; round at the rugs and furniture.
&#8220;Hope we haven&#8217;t pulled up at the wrong
ranch. Are you Shorty McCabe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Among old friends, I am,&#8221; says I, &#8220;Now
if you come under&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Phemey,&#8221; says she, motionin&#8217;
to the short one. &#8220;Sit down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Don&#8217;t mind the furniture.
Take a couple of chairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for me!&#8221; says the tall one. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
stand in one spot and drip, and then you can
mop up afterwards. But Phemey, she&#8217;s plumb
tuckered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sweet of you to run in,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Been
wadin&#8217; in the park lake, or enjoyin&#8217; the
shower?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enjoying the shower is good,&#8221; says she;
&#8220;but I hadn&#8217;t thought of describing it that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
way. I reckon, though, you&#8217;d like to hear who
we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, any time when you get to that,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a joke, is it?&#8221; says she. &#8220;If it is,
Ha, ha! Excuse me if I don&#8217;t laugh real
hearty. I can do better when I don&#8217;t feel so
much like a sponge. Maizie May Blickens is
my name, and this is Euphemia Blickens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Sisters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we look it?&#8221; says Maizie. &#8220;No!
First cousins on the whiskered side. Ever
hear that name Blickens before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; says I, scratchin&#8217; my
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t dig too deep,&#8221; says Maizie. &#8220;How
about Blickens&#8217; skating rink in Kansas City?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Was it run by a gent they
called Sport Blickens?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sure,&#8221; I goes on. &#8220;And the night I
had my match there with the Pedlar, when I&#8217;d
spent my last bean on a month&#8217;s trainin&#8217; expenses,
and the Pedlar&#8217;s backer was wavin&#8217; a
thousand-dollar side bet under my nose, this
Mr. Blickens chucked me his roll and told me
to call the bluff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that was dad, all right,&#8221; says Maizie.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Well, well! Now if
there&#8217;s anything I can do for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa up!&#8221; says Maizie. &#8220;This is no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
grubstake touch. Let&#8217;s get that off our minds
first, though I&#8217;m just as much obliged. It&#8217;s
come out as dad said. Says he, &#8216;If you&#8217;re ever
up against it, and can locate Shorty McCabe,
you go to him and say who you are.&#8217; But this
isn&#8217;t exactly that kind of a case. Phemey and
I may look a bit rocky and&mdash;&mdash; Say, how do we
look, anyway? Have you got such a thing as
a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tidson,&#8221; says Sadie, breakin&#8217; in, &#8220;you
may roll in the pier glass for the young lady.&#8221;
Course, that reminds me I ain&#8217;t done the honors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Miss Blickens, this
is Mrs. McCabe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy,&#8221; says Maizie. &#8220;I was wondering
if it wasn&#8217;t about due. Goshety gosh! but
you&#8217;re all to the peaches, eh? And me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here she turns and takes a full length view of
herself. &#8220;Suffering scarecrows! Say, why
didn&#8217;t you put up the bars on us? Don&#8217;t you
look, Phemey; you&#8217;d swallow your gum!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Euphemia ain&#8217;t got any idea of turnin&#8217;
her head. She has them peaceful eyes of hers
glued to Sadie&#8217;s copper hair, and she&#8217;s contented
to yank away at her cud. For a consistent
and perseverin&#8217; masticator, she has our
friend Fletcher chewed to a standstill. Maizie
is soon satisfied with her survey.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do, take it away,&#8221; says she. &#8220;If
I ever get real stuck on myself, I&#8217;ll have something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
to remember. But, as I was sayin&#8217;, this
is no case of an escape from the poor farm. We
wore these Hetty Green togs when we left
Dobie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dobie?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, laugh!&#8221; says Maizie. &#8220;Dobie&#8217;s
the biggest joke and the slowest four corners in
the State of Minnesota, and that&#8217;s putting it
strong. Look at Phemey; she&#8217;s a native.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, we looked at Phemey. Couldn&#8217;t help
it. Euphemia don&#8217;t seem to mind. She don&#8217;t
even grin; but just goes on workin&#8217; her jaws
and lookin&#8217; placid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out in Dobie that would pass for hysterics,&#8221;
says Maizie. &#8220;The only way they
could account for me was by saying that I was
born crazy in another State. I&#8217;ve had a good
many kinds of hard luck; but being born in
Dobie wasn&#8217;t one of the varieties. Now can you
stand the story of my life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Blickens,&#8221; says I, &#8220;I&#8217;m willin&#8217; to pay
you by the hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t so bad as all that,&#8221; says she, &#8220;because
precious little has ever happened to me.
It&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to happen that I&#8217;m living for.
But, to take a fair start, we&#8217;ll begin with dad.
When they called him Sport Blickens, they
didn&#8217;t stretch their imaginations. He was all
that&mdash;and not much else. All I know about
maw is that she was one of three, and that I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
born in the back room of a Denver dance hall.
I&#8217;ve got a picture of her, wearing tights and a
tin helmet, and dad says she was a hummer.
He ought to know; he was a pretty good judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I wasn&#8217;t much over two days old when
they had the funeral, I can&#8217;t add anything more
about maw. And the history I could write of
dad would make a mighty slim book. Running
roller skating rinks was the most genteel business
he ever got into, I guess. His regular profession
was faro. It&#8217;s an unhealthy game,
especially in those gold camps where they shoot
so impetuous. He got over the effects of two .38&#8217;s
dealt him by a halfbreed Sioux; but when
a real bad man from Taunton, Massachusetts,
opened up on him across the table with a .45, he
just naturally got discouraged. Good old dad!
He meant well when he left me in Dobie and
had me adopted by Uncle Hen. Phemey, you
needn&#8217;t listen to this next chapter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Euphemia, she misses two jaw strokes in succession,
rolls her eyes at Maizie May for a
second, and then strikes her reg&#8217;lar gait again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse her getting excited like that,&#8221; says
Maizie; &#8220;but Uncle Hen&mdash;that was her old
man, of course&mdash;hasn&#8217;t been planted long. He
lasted until three weeks ago. He was an awful
good man, Uncle Hen was&mdash;to himself. He had
the worst case of ingrowing religion you ever
saw. Why, he had a thumb felon once, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
when the doctor came to lance it Uncle Hen
made him wait until he could call in the minister,
so it could be opened with prayer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sundays he made us go to church twice,
and the rest of the day he talked to us about
our souls. Between times he ran the Palace
Emporium; that is, he and I and a half baked
Swede by the name of Jens Torkil did. To look
at Jens you wouldn&#8217;t have thought he could
have been taught the difference between a can
of salmon and a patent corn planter; but say,
Uncle Hen had him trained to make short
change and weigh his hand with every piece of
salt pork, almost as slick as he could do it
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I had to do was to tend the drygoods,
candy, and drug counters, look after the post-office
window, keep the books, and manage the
telephone exchange. Euphemia had the softest
snap, though. She did the housework, planted
the garden, raised chickens, fed the hogs, and
scrubbed the floors. Have I got the catalogue
right, Phemey?&#8221;</p>
<p>Euphemia blinks twice, kind of reminiscent;
but nothin&#8217; in the shape of words gets through
the gum.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has such an emotional nature!&#8221; says
Maizie. &#8220;Uncle Hen was like that too. But
let&#8217;s not linger over him. He&#8217;s gone. The last
thing he did was to let go of a dollar fifty in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
cash that I held him up for so Phemey and I
could go into Duluth and see a show. The end
came early next day, and whether it was from
shock or enlargement of the heart, no one will
ever know.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an awful blow to us all. We went
around in a daze for nearly a week, hardly daring
to believe that it could be so. Jens broke
the spell for us. One morning I caught him
helping himself to a cigar out of the two-fer
box. &#8216;Why not?&#8217; says he. Next Phemey
walks in, swipes a package of wintergreen gum,
and feeds it all in at once. She says, &#8216;Why
not?&#8217; too. Then I woke up. &#8216;You&#8217;re right,&#8217;
says I. &#8216;Enjoy yourself. It&#8217;s time.&#8217; Next I
hints to her that there are bigger and brighter
spots on this earth than Dobie, and asks her
what she says to selling the Emporium and
hunting them up. &#8216;I don&#8217;t care,&#8217; says she,
and that was a good deal of a speech for her
to make. &#8216;Do you leave it to me?&#8217; says I.
&#8216;Uh-huh,&#8217; says she. &#8216;We-e-e-ough!&#8217; says I,&#8221;
and with that Maizie lets out one of them backwoods
college cries that brings Tidson up on
his toes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I take it,&#8221; says I, &#8220;that you did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I?&#8221; says she. &#8220;Inside of three days
I&#8217;d hustled up four different parties that
wanted to invest in a going concern, and before
the week was over I&#8217;d buncoed one of &#8217;em
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
out of nine thousand in cash. Most of it&#8217;s in a
certified check, sewed inside of Phemey, and
that&#8217;s why we walked all the way up here in the
rain. Do you suppose you could take me to
some bank to-morrow where I could leave that
and get a handful of green bills on account?
Is that asking too much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Considering the way you&#8217;ve brushed up my
memory of Sport Blickens,&#8221; says I, &#8220;it&#8217;s real
modest. Couldn&#8217;t you think of something
else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that had come from Mrs. McCabe,&#8221; says
she, eyin&#8217; Sadie kind of longin&#8217;, &#8220;I reckon I
could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; says Sadie, &#8220;I should be delighted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t go so far as to lead two such
freaks as us around to the stores and help us
pick out some New York clothes, would you?&#8221;
says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear girl!&#8221; says Sadie, grabbin&#8217; both
her hands. &#8220;We&#8217;ll do it to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest?&#8221; says Maizie, beamin&#8217; on her.
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what I call right down decent.
Phemey, do you hear that? Oh, swallow it,
Phemey, swallow it! This is where we bloom
out!&#8221;</p>
<p>And say, you should have heard them talkin&#8217;
over the kind of trousseaus that would best help
a girl to forget she ever came from Dobie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You will need a neat cloth street dress, for
afternoons,&#8221; says Sadie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for me!&#8221; says Maizie. &#8220;That&#8217;ll do
all right for Phemey; but when it comes to me,
I&#8217;ll take something that rustles. I&#8217;ve worn
back number cast-offs for twenty-two years;
now I&#8217;m ready for the other kind. I&#8217;ve been
traveling so far behind the procession I couldn&#8217;t
tell which way it was going. Now I&#8217;m going to
give the drum major a view of my back hair.
The sort of costumes I want are the kind that
are designed this afternoon for day after to-morrow.
If it&#8217;s checks, I&#8217;ll take two to the
piece; if it&#8217;s stripes, I want to make a circus
zebra look like a clipped mule. And I want a
change for every day in the week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear girl,&#8221; says Sadie, &#8220;can you
afford to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I can!&#8221; says Maizie. &#8220;My share
of Uncle Hen&#8217;s pile is forty-five hundred dollars,
and while it lasts I&#8217;m going to have the
lilies of the field looking like the flowers you
see on attic wall paper. I don&#8217;t care what I
have to eat, or where I stay; but when it comes
to clothes, show me the limit! But say, I guess
it&#8217;s time we were getting back to our boarding-house.
Wake up, Phemey!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I pilots &#8217;em out to Fifth-ave., stows &#8217;em
into a motor stage, and heads &#8217;em down town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; says Sadie, when I gets back. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
suppose that is a sample of Western breeziness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more&#8217;n a sample,&#8221; says I. &#8220;But I can
see her finish, though. Inside of three months
all she&#8217;ll have left to show for her wad will be
a trunk full of fancy regalia and a board bill.
Then it will be Maizie hunting a job in some
beanery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I shall talk her out of that nonsense,&#8221;
says Sadie. &#8220;What she ought to do is to take
a course in stenography and shorthand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, we laid out a full programme for Maizie,
and had her earnin&#8217; her little twenty a week,
with Phemey keepin&#8217; house for both of &#8217;em in
a nice little four-room flat. And in the mornin&#8217;
I helps her deposit the certified check, and then
turns the pair over to Sadie for an assault on
the department stores, with a call at a business
college as a finish for the day, as we&#8217;d planned.</p>
<p>When I gets home that night I finds Sadie all
fagged out and drinkin&#8217; bromo seltzer for a
headache.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; says Sadie; &#8220;only I&#8217;ve been
having the time of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Buying tailor made uniforms for the Misses
Blickens?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tailor made nothing!&#8221; says Sadie. &#8220;It
was no use, Shorty, I had to give in. Maizie
wanted the other things so badly. And then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
Euphemia declared she must have the same
kind. So I spent the whole day fitting them
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got &#8217;em something sudden and noisy, eh?&#8221;
says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wait until you see them,&#8221; says Sadie.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s the idea?&#8221; says I. &#8220;How
long do they think they can keep up that pace?
And when they&#8217;ve blown themselves short of
breath, what then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven knows!&#8221; says Sadie. &#8220;But
Maizie has plans of her own. When I mentioned
the business college, she just laughed,
and said if she couldn&#8217;t do something better
than pound a typewriter, she&#8217;d go back to Dobie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Sentiments like that has
got lots of folks into trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; says Sadie, &#8220;Maizie&#8217;s a nice
girl in her way. We&#8217;ll see how she comes out.&#8221;</p>
<p>We did, too. It was a couple of weeks before
we heard a word from either of &#8217;em, and then
the other day Sadie gets a call over the &#8217;phone
from a perfect stranger. She says she&#8217;s a Mrs.
Herman Zorn, of West End-ave., and that she&#8217;s
givin&#8217; a little roof garden theater party that
evenin&#8217;, in honor of Miss Maizie Blickens, an
old friend of hers that she used to know when
she lived in St. Paul and spent her summers
near Dobie. Also she understood we were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
friends of Miss Blickens too, and she&#8217;d be
pleased to have us join.</p>
<p>&#8220;West End-ave.!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Gee! but it
looks like Maizie had been able to butt in. Do
we go, Sadie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said we&#8217;d be charmed,&#8221; says she. &#8220;I&#8217;m
dying to see how Maizie will look.&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t admit it, but I was some curious that
way myself; so about eight-fifteen we shows up
at the roof garden and has an usher lead us to
the bunch. There&#8217;s half a dozen of &#8217;em on
hand; but the only thing worth lookin&#8217; at was
Maizie May.</p>
<p>And say, I thought I could make a guess as
to somewhere near how she would frame up.
The picture I had in mind was a sort of cross
between a Grand-st. Rebecca and an Eighth-ave.
Lizzie Maud,&mdash;you know, one of the near
style girls, that&#8217;s got on all the novelties from
ten bargain counters. But, gee! The view I
gets has me gaspin&#8217;. Maizie wa&#8217;n&#8217;t near; she
was two jumps ahead. And it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any
Grand-st. fashion plate that she was a livin&#8217;
model of. It was Fifth-ave. and upper Broadway.
Talk about your down-to-the-minute costumes!
Say, maybe they&#8217;ll be wearin&#8217; dresses
like that a year from now. And that hat! It
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t a dream; it was a forecast.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw it unpacked from the Paris case,&#8221;
whispers Sadie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>All I know about it is that it was the widest,
featheriest lid I ever saw in captivity, and it&#8217;s
balanced on more hair puffs than you could put
in a barrel. But what added the swell, artistic
touch was the collar. It&#8217;s a chin supporter
and ear embracer. I thought I&#8217;d seen high
ones, but this twelve-inch picket fence around
Maizie&#8217;s neck was the loftiest choker I ever saw
anyone survive. To watch her wear it gave
you the same sensations as bein&#8217; a witness at a
hanging. How she could do it and keep on
breathin&#8217;, I couldn&#8217;t make out; but it don&#8217;t seem
to interfere with her talkin&#8217;.</p>
<p>Sittin&#8217; close up beside her, and listenin&#8217; with
both ears stretched and his mouth open, was
a blond young gent with a bristly Bat Nelson
pompadour. He&#8217;s rigged out in a silk faced
tuxedo, a smoke colored, open face vest, and he
has a big yellow orchid in his buttonhole. By
the way he&#8217;s gazin&#8217; at Maizie, you could tell he
approved of her from the ground up. She don&#8217;t
hesitate any on droppin&#8217; him, though, when we
arrives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; says she. &#8220;Ripping good of you
to come. Well, what do you think? I&#8217;ve got
some of &#8217;em on, you see. What&#8217;s the effect?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stunning!&#8221; says Sadie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; says Maizie. &#8220;I laid out to get
somewhere near that. And, gosh! but it feels
good! These are the kind of togs I was born to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
wear. Phemey? Oh, she&#8217;s laid up with arnica
bandages around her throat. I told her she
mustn&#8217;t try to chew gum with one of these
collars on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Maizie,&#8221; says I, &#8220;who&#8217;s the Sir Lionel
Budweiser, and where did you pick him
up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Oscar!&#8221; says she. &#8220;Why, he found
me. He&#8217;s from St. Paul, nephew of Mrs. Zorn,
who&#8217;s visiting her. Brewer&#8217;s son, you know.
Money? They&#8217;ve got bales of it. Hey, Oscar!&#8221;
says she, snappin&#8217; her finger. &#8220;Come
over here and show yourself!&#8221;</p>
<p>And say, he was trained, all right. He trots
right over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you take him, if you was me?&#8221; says
Maizie, turnin&#8217; him round for us to make an inspection.
&#8220;I told him I wouldn&#8217;t say positive
until I had shown him to you, Mrs. McCabe.
He&#8217;s a little under height, and I don&#8217;t like the
way his hair grows; but his habits are good, and
his allowance is thirty thousand a year. How
about him? Will he do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; says Sadie, and it&#8217;s one of
the few times I ever saw her rattled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just flash that ring again, Oscar,&#8221; says
Maizie.</p>
<p>&#8220;O-o-oh!&#8221; says Sadie, when Oscar has
pulled out the white satin box and snapped back
the cover. &#8220;What a beauty! Yes, Maizie, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
should say that, if you like Oscar, he would do
nicely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That goes!&#8221; says Maizie. &#8220;Here, Occie
dear, slide it on. But remember: Phemey has
got to live with us until I can pick out some
victim of nervous prostration that needs a wife
like her. And for goodness&#8217; sake, Occie, give
that waiter an order for something wet!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; says Sadie afterwards, lettin&#8217; out
a long breath. &#8220;To think that we ever worried
about her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a little bit of all right, eh?&#8221; says I.
&#8220;But say, I&#8217;m glad I ain&#8217;t Occie, the heir to
the brewery. I wouldn&#8217;t know whether I was
engaged to Maizie, or caught in a belt.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>WHERE SPOTTY FITTED IN</h3>
</div>

<p>Also we have a few home-grown varieties
that ain&#8217;t listed frequent. And the pavement
products are apt to have most as queer kinks
to &#8217;em as those from the plowed fields. Now
take Spotty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! what a merry look!&#8221; says I to Pinckney
as he floats into the studio here the other
day. He&#8217;s holdin&#8217; his chin high, and he&#8217;s got
his stick tucked up under his arm, and them
black eyes of his is just sparklin&#8217;. &#8220;What&#8217;s it
all about?&#8221; I goes on. &#8220;Is it a good one
you&#8217;ve just remembered, or has something
humorous happened to one of your best
friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a new idea,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Why, that&#8217;s excuse
enough for declarin&#8217; a gen&#8217;ral holiday. Did
you go after it, or was it delivered by mistake?
Can&#8217;t you give us a scenario of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve thought of something new for
Spotty Cahill,&#8221; says he, beamin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;G&#8217;wan!&#8221; says I. &#8220;I might have known it
was a false alarm. Spotty Cahill! Say, do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
you want to know what I&#8217;d advise you to do for
Spotty next?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, Pinckney don&#8217;t want my views on the
subject. It&#8217;s a topic we&#8217;ve threshed out between
us before; also it&#8217;s one of the few dozen
that we could debate from now until there&#8217;s
skatin&#8217; on the Panama Canal, without gettin&#8217;
anywhere. I&#8217;ve always held that Spotty Cahill
was about the most useless and undeservin&#8217;
human being that ever managed to exist without
work; but to hear Pinckney talk you&#8217;d think
that long-legged, carroty-haired young loafer
was the original party that philanthropy was
invented for.</p>
<p>Now, doing things for other folks ain&#8217;t one
of Pinckney&#8217;s strong points, as a rule. Not
that he wouldn&#8217;t if he thought of it and could
find the time; but gen&#8217;rally he has too many
other things on his schedule to indulge much
in the little deeds of kindness game. When he
does start out to do good, though, he makes a
job of it. But look who he picks out!</p>
<p>Course, I knew why. He&#8217;s explained all that
to me more&#8217;n once. Seems there was an old
waiter at the club, a quiet, soft-spoken, bald-headed
relic, who had served him with more
lobster Newburg than you could load on a
scow, and enough highballs to float the <i>Mauretania</i>
in. In fact, he&#8217;d been waitin&#8217; there as
long as Pinckney had been a member. They&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
been kind of chummy, in a way, too. It had always
been &#8220;Good morning, Peter,&#8221; and &#8220;Hope
I see you well, sir,&#8221; between them, and Pinckney
never had to bother about whether he liked
a dash of bitters in this, or if that ought to
be served frappe or plain. Peter knew, and
Peter never forgot.</p>
<p>Then one day when Pinckney&#8217;s just squarin&#8217;
off to his lunch he notices that he&#8217;s been given
plain, ordinary salt butter instead of the sweet
kind he always has; so he puts up a finger to
call Peter over and have a swap made. When
he glances up, though, he finds Peter ain&#8217;t there
at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I say,&#8221; says he, &#8220;but where is
Peter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter, sir?&#8221; says the new man. &#8220;Very
sorry, sir, but Peter&#8217;s dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead!&#8221; says Pinckney. &#8220;Why&mdash;why&mdash;how
long has that been?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over a month, sir,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Anything
wrong, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>To be sure, Pinckney hadn&#8217;t been there reg&#8217;lar;
but he&#8217;d been in off and on, and when he
comes to think how this old chap, that knew
all his whims, and kept track of &#8217;em so faithful,
had dropped out without his ever having heard
a word about it&mdash;why, he felt kind of broke up.
You see, he&#8217;d always meant to do something nice
for old Peter; but he&#8217;d never got round to it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
and here the first thing he knows Peter&#8217;s been
under the sod for more&#8217;n a month.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what set Pinckney to inquirin&#8217; if Peter
hadn&#8217;t left a fam&#8217;ly or anything, which results
in his diggin&#8217; up this Spotty youth. I
forgot just what his first name was, it being
something outlandish that don&#8217;t go with Cahill
at all; but it seems he was born over in India,
where old Peter was soldierin&#8217; at the time, and
they&#8217;d picked up one of the native names. Maybe
that&#8217;s what ailed the boy from the start.</p>
<p>Anyway, Peter had come back from there a
widower, drifted to New York with the youngster,
and got into the waiter business. Meantime
the boy grows up in East Side boardin&#8217;-houses,
without much lookin&#8217; after, and when
Pinckney finds him he&#8217;s an int&#8217;restin&#8217; product.
He&#8217;s twenty-odd, about five feet eleven high,
weighs under one hundred and thirty, has a
shock of wavy, brick-red hair that almost hides
his ears, and his chief accomplishments are
playin&#8217; Kelly pool and consumin&#8217; cigarettes.
By way of ornament he has the most complete
collection of freckles I ever see on a human
face, or else it was they stood out more prominent
because the skin was so white between the
splotches. We didn&#8217;t invent the name Spotty
for him. He&#8217;d already been tagged that.</p>
<p>Well, Pinckney discovers that Spotty has been
livin&#8217; on the few dollars that was left after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
payin&#8217; old Peter&#8217;s plantin&#8217; expenses; that he
didn&#8217;t know what he was goin&#8217; to do after that
was gone, and didn&#8217;t seem to care. So Pinckney
jumps in, works his pull with the steward,
and has Spotty put on reg&#8217;lar in the club billiard
room as an attendant. All he has to do is help
with the cleanin&#8217;, keep the tables brushed, and
set up the balls when there are games goin&#8217; on.
He gets his meals free, and six dollars a week.</p>
<p>Now that should have been a soft enough
snap for anybody, even the born tired kind.
There wa&#8217;n&#8217;t work enough in it to raise a palm
callous on a baby. But Spotty, he improves on
that. His idea of earnin&#8217; wages is to curl up
in a sunny windowseat and commune with his
soul. Wherever you found the sun streamin&#8217;
in, there was a good place to look for Spotty.
He just seemed to soak it up, like a blotter does
ink, and it didn&#8217;t disturb him any who was
doin&#8217; his work.</p>
<p>Durin&#8217; the first six months Spotty was fired
eight times, only to have Pinckney get him reinstated,
and it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t until the steward went to
the board of governors with the row that Mr.
Cahill was given his permanent release. You
might think Pinckney would have called it quits
then; but not him! He&#8217;d started out to godfather
Spotty, and he stays right with the
game. Everybody he knew was invited to help
along the good work of givin&#8217; Spotty a lift. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
got him into brokers&#8217; offices, tried him out as
bellhop in four diff&#8217;rent hotels, and even
jammed him by main strength into a bank; but
Spotty&#8217;s sun absorbin&#8217; habits couldn&#8217;t seem to
be made useful anywhere.</p>
<p>For one while he got chummy with Swifty
Joe and took to sunnin&#8217; himself in the studio
front windows, until I had to veto that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind your friends droppin&#8217; in now
and then, Swifty,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but there ain&#8217;t
any room here for statuary. I don&#8217;t care how
gentle you break it to him, only run him out.&#8221;</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t enthuse much when
Pinckney says he&#8217;s thought up some new
scheme for Spotty. &#8220;Goin&#8217; to have him
probed for hookworms?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>No, that ain&#8217;t it. Pinckney, he&#8217;s had a talk
with Spotty and discovered that old Peter had
a brother Aloysius, who&#8217;s settled somewhere
up in Canada and is superintendent of a big
wheat farm. Pinckney&#8217;s had his lawyers trace
out this Uncle Aloysius, and then he&#8217;s written
him all about Spotty, suggestin&#8217; that he send for
him by return mail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; says I. &#8220;He&#8217;d be a lot of use on
a wheat farm. What does Aloysius have to
say to the proposition?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the fact is,&#8221; says Pinckney, &#8220;he
doesn&#8217;t appear at all enthusiastic. He writes
that if the boy is anything like Peter when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
knew him he&#8217;s not anxious to see him. However,
he says that if Spotty comes on he will
do what he can for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be a long walk,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s where my idea comes in,&#8221; says
Pinckney. &#8220;I am going to finance the trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it don&#8217;t cost too much,&#8221; says I, &#8220;it&#8217;ll be
a good investment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinckney wants to do the thing right away,
too. First off, though, he has to locate Spotty.
The youth has been at large for a week or more
now, since he was last handed the fresh air,
and Pinckney ain&#8217;t heard a word from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Swifty knows where he roosts,&#8221;
says I.</p>
<p>It was a good guess. Swifty gives us a number
on Fourth-ave. where he&#8217;d seen Spotty
hangin&#8217; around lately, and he thinks likely he&#8217;s
there yet.</p>
<p>So me and Pinckney starts out on the trail.
It leads us to one of them Turkish auction
joints where they sell genuine silk oriental
prayer rugs, made in Paterson, N. J., with hammered
brass bowls and antique guns as a side
line. And, sure enough, camped down in front
on a sample rug, with his hat off and the sun
full on him, is our friend Spotty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; says Pinckney. &#8220;Regularly
employed here, are you, Spotty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? Nah!&#8221; says Spotty, lookin&#8217; disgusted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
at the thought. &#8220;I&#8217;m only stayin&#8217;
around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you afraid the sun will fade them
curly locks of yours?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, quit your kiddin&#8217;!&#8221; says Spotty,
startin&#8217; to roll a fresh cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind Shorty,&#8221; says Pinckney. &#8220;I
have some good news for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>That don&#8217;t excite Spotty a bit. &#8220;Not another
job!&#8221; he groans.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; says Pinckney, and then he explains
about finding Uncle Aloysius, windin&#8217; up
by askin&#8217; Spotty how he&#8217;d like to go up there
and live.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; says Spotty. &#8220;Good ways
off, ain&#8217;t it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, rather,&#8221; admits Pinckney; &#8220;but that
need not trouble you. What do you think I
am going to do for you, Spotty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it up,&#8221; says he, calmly lightin&#8217; a match
and proceedin&#8217; with the smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says Pinckney, &#8220;because of the
long and faithful service of your father, and the
many little personal attentions he paid me, I
am going to give you&mdash;&mdash; Wait! Here it is
now,&#8221; and hanged if Pinckney don&#8217;t fork over
ten new twenty-dollar bills. &#8220;There!&#8221; says
he. &#8220;That ought to be enough to fit you out
well and take you there in good shape. Here&#8217;s
the address too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>Does Spotty jump up and crack his heels together
and sputter out how thankful he is?
Nothin&#8217; so strenuous. He fumbles the bills
over curious for a minute, then wads &#8217;em up
and jams &#8217;em into his pocket. &#8220;Much
obliged,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come around to Shorty&#8217;s with your new
clothes on to-morrow afternoon about four
o&#8217;clock,&#8221; says Pinckney, &#8220;and let us see how
you look. And&mdash;er&mdash;by the way, Spotty, is
that a friend of yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d been noticin&#8217; her too, standin&#8217; just inside
the doorway pipin&#8217; us off. She&#8217;s a slim, big-eyed,
black-haired young woman, dressed in the
height of Grand-st. fashion, and wearin&#8217; a lot
of odd, cheap lookin&#8217; jewelry. If it hadn&#8217;t been
for the straight nose and the thin lips you might
have guessed that her first name was Rebecca.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, her?&#8221; says Spotty, turnin&#8217; languid to
see who he meant. &#8220;That&#8217;s Mareena. Her
father runs the shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Armenian?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Syrian,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite some of a looker, eh?&#8221; says I, tryin&#8217;
to sound him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so bad,&#8221; says Spotty, hunchin&#8217; his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;er&mdash;do I understand,&#8221; says Pinckney,
&#8220;that there is&mdash;ah&mdash;some attachment between
you and&mdash;er&mdash;the young lady?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Blamed if I know,&#8221; says Spotty. &#8220;Better
ask her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Course, we couldn&#8217;t very well do that, and as
Spotty don&#8217;t seem bubblin&#8217; over with information
he has to chop it off there. Pinckney,
though, is more or less int&#8217;rested in the situation.
He wonders if he&#8217;s done just right,
handin&#8217; over all that money to Spotty in a
place like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wa&#8217;n&#8217;t what you&#8217;d call a shrewd move,&#8221;
says I. &#8220;Seems to me I&#8217;d bought his ticket,
anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but I wanted to get it off my mind,
you know,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Odd, though, his being
there. I wonder what sort of persons those
Syrians are!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never can tell,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>The more Pinckney thinks of it, the more uneasy
he gets, and when four o&#8217;clock comes next
day, with no Spotty showin&#8217; up, he begins to
have furrows in his brow. &#8220;If he&#8217;s been done
away with, it&#8217;s my fault,&#8221; says Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, don&#8217;t start worryin&#8217; yet,&#8221; says I.
&#8220;Give him time.&#8221;</p>
<p>By five o&#8217;clock, though, Pinckney has
imagined all sorts of things,&mdash;Spotty bein&#8217;
found carved up and sewed in a sack, and him
called into court to testify as to where he saw
him last. &#8220;And all because I gave him that
money!&#8221; he groans.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, can it!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Them sensation
pictures of yours are makin&#8217; me nervous. Here,
I&#8217;ll go down and see if they&#8217;ve finished wipin&#8217;
off the daggers, while you send Swifty out after
something soothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that off I hikes as a rescue expedition.
I finds the red flag still out, the sample rug
still in place; but there&#8217;s no Spotty in evidence.
Neither is there any sign of the girl. So I
walks into the store, gazin&#8217; around sharp for
any stains on the floor.</p>
<p>Out from behind a curtain at the far end of
the shop comes a fat, wicked lookin&#8217; old pirate,
with a dark greasy face and shiny little eyes
like a pair of needles. He&#8217;s wearin&#8217; a dinky
gold-braided cap, baggy trousers, and he carries
a long pipe in one hand. If he didn&#8217;t look
like he&#8217;d do extemporaneous surgery for the
sake of a dollar bill, then I&#8217;m no judge. I&#8217;ve
got in too far to look up a cop, so I takes a
chance on a strong bluff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you!&#8221; I sings out. &#8220;What&#8217;s happened
to Spotty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spot-tee?&#8221; says he. &#8220;Spot-tee?&#8221; He
shrugs his shoulders and pretends to look
dazed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Spotty,&#8221; says I, &#8220;red-headed, freckle-faced
young gent. You know him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; says he, tappin&#8217; his head. &#8220;The
golden crowned! El Sareef Ka-heel?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the name, Cahill,&#8221; says I. &#8220;He&#8217;s
a friend of a friend of mine, and you might as
well get it through your nut right now that if
anything&#8217;s happened to him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a friend of Sareef Ka-heel?&#8221; he
breaks in, eyin&#8217; me suspicious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once removed,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but it amounts to
the same thing. Now where is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For a friend&mdash;well, I know not,&#8221; says the
old boy, kind of hesitatin&#8217;. Then, with another
shrug, he makes up his mind. &#8220;So it shall be.
Come. You shall see the Sareef.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that he beckons me to follow and starts
towards the back. I went through one dark
room, expectin&#8217; to feel a knife in my ribs every
minute, and then we goes through another. Next
thing I knew we&#8217;re out in a little back yard, half
full of empty cases and crates. In the middle
of a clear space is a big brown tent, with the
flap pinned back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; says the old gent, &#8220;your friend, the
Sareef Ka-heel!&#8221;</p>
<p>Say, for a minute I thought it was a trap he&#8217;s
springin&#8217; on me; but after I&#8217;d looked long
enough I see who he&#8217;s pointin&#8217; at. The party
inside is squattin&#8217; cross-legged on a rug, holdin&#8217;
the business end of one of these water bottle
pipes in his mouth. He&#8217;s wearin&#8217; some kind of
a long bath robe, and most of his red hair is
concealed by yards of white cloth twisted round
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
his head; but it&#8217;s Spotty all right, alive, uncarved,
and lookin&#8217; happy and contented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, for the love of soup!&#8221; says I.
&#8220;What is it, a masquerade?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you, McCabe?&#8221; says he. &#8220;Come in
and&mdash;and sit on the floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; says I, steppin&#8217; inside, &#8220;this ain&#8217;t
the costume you&#8217;re going to start for Canada
in, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, forget Canada!&#8221; says he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
that proposition beat a mile. Hey, Hazzam,&#8221;
and he calls to the old pirate outside, &#8220;tell
Mrs. Cahill to come down and be introduced!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; says I. &#8220;You&mdash;you ain&#8217;t
been gettin&#8217; married, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; says Spotty, grinnin&#8217; foolish. &#8220;Nine
o&#8217;clock last night. We&#8217;re goin&#8217; to start on our
weddin&#8217; trip Tuesday, me and Mareena.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mareena!&#8221; I gasps. &#8220;Not the&mdash;the one
we saw out front? Where you going, Niagara?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah! Syria, wherever that is,&#8221; says he.
&#8220;Mareena knows. We&#8217;re goin&#8217; to live over
there and buy rugs. That two hundred was
just what we needed to set us up in business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think you&#8217;ll like it?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; says he. &#8220;She says it&#8217;s fine.
There&#8217;s deserts over there, and you travel for
days and days, ridin&#8217; on bloomin&#8217; camels.
Here&#8217;s the tent we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to live in. I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
practisin&#8217; up. Gee! but this pipe is somethin&#8217;
fierce, though! Oh, here she is! Say, Mareena,
this is Mr. McCabe, that I was tellin&#8217;
you about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, honest, I wouldn&#8217;t have known her for
the same girl. She&#8217;s changed that Grand-st.
uniform for a native outfit, and while it&#8217;s a
little gaudy in color, hanged if it ain&#8217;t becomin&#8217;!
For a desert bride I should say she had some
class.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says I, &#8220;so you and Spotty are
goin&#8217; to leave us, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes!&#8221; says she, them big black eyes
of hers lightin&#8217; up. &#8220;We go where the sky is
high and blue and the sun is big and hot. We
go back to the wide white desert where I was
born. All day we shall ride toward the purple
hills, and sleep at night under the still stars.
He knows. I have told him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; says Spotty. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be all
to the good, that. Mareena can cook too.&#8221;</p>
<p>To prove it, she makes coffee and hands it
around in little brass cups. Also there&#8217;s cakes,
and the old man comes in, smilin&#8217; and rubbin&#8217;
his hands, and we has a real sociable time.</p>
<p>And these was the folks I&#8217;d suspected of
wantin&#8217; to carve up Spotty! Why, by the looks
I saw thrown at him by them two, I knew
they thought him the finest thing that ever happened.
Just by the way Mareena reached out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
sly to pat his hair when she passed, you could
see how it was.</p>
<p>So I wished &#8217;em luck and hurried back to report
before Pinckney sent a squad of reserves
after me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; says he, the minute I gets in. &#8220;Let
me know the worst at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; says I. &#8220;He&#8217;s married.&#8221; It was
all I could do, too, to make him believe the
yarn.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; says he. &#8220;Think of a chap
like Spotty Cahill tumbling into a romance like
that! And on Fourth-ave!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t so well advertised as some other
lanes in this town,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but it&#8217;s a great
street. Say, what puzzled me most about the
whole business, though, was the new name they
had for Spotty. Sareef! What in blazes does
that mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably a title of some sort,&#8221; says Pinckney.
&#8220;Like sheik, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what does a Sareef have to do?&#8221;
says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do!&#8221; says Pinckney. &#8220;Why, he&#8217;s boss
of the caravan. He&mdash;he sits around in the sun
and looks picturesque.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that settles it,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Spotty&#8217;s
qualified. I never thought there was any place
where he&#8217;d fit in; but, if your description&#8217;s correct,
he&#8217;s found the job he was born for.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>A GRANDMOTHER WHO GOT GOING</h3>
</div>

<p>Ever go on a grandmother hunt through the
Red Ink District? Well, it ain&#8217;t a reg&#8217;lar
amusement of mine, but it has its good points.
Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t have tackled it at all if I
hadn&#8217;t begun by lettin&#8217; myself get int&#8217;rested in
Vincent&#8217;s domestic affairs.</p>
<p>Now what I knew about this Vincent chap
before we starts out on the grandmother trail
wouldn&#8217;t take long to tell. He wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any special
friend of mine. For one thing, he wears his
hair cut plush. Course, it&#8217;s his hair, and if he
wants to train it to stand up on top like a
clothes brush or a blacking dauber, who am I
that should curl the lip of scorn?</p>
<p>Just the same, I never could feel real chummy
towards anyone that sported one of them self
raisin&#8217; crests. Vincent wa&#8217;n&#8217;t one of the
chummy kind, though. He&#8217;s one of these stiff
backed, black haired, brown eyed, quick motioned,
sharp spoken ducks, that wants what he
wants when he wants it. You know. He comes
to the studio reg&#8217;lar, does his forty-five minutes&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
work, and gets out without swappin&#8217; any more
conversation than is strictly necessary.</p>
<p>All the information I had picked up about
him was that he hailed from up the State somewhere,
and that soon after he struck New York
he married one of the Chetwood girls. And
that takes more or less capital to start with.
Guess Vincent had it; for I hear his old man
left him quite a wad and that now he&#8217;s the
main guy of a threshin&#8217; machine trust, or something
like that. Anyway, Vincent belongs in
the four-cylinder plute class, and he&#8217;s beginnin&#8217;
to be heard of among the alimony aristocracy.</p>
<p>But this ain&#8217;t got anything to do with the
way he happened to get confidential all so sudden.
He&#8217;d been havin&#8217; a kid pillow mix-up
with Swifty Joe, just as lively as if the thermometer
was down to thirty instead of up to
ninety, and he&#8217;s just had his rub down and got
into his featherweight serge, when in drifts this
Rodney Kipp that&#8217;s figurin&#8217; so strong on the
defense side of them pipe line cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Vincent!&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Rodney!&#8221; says Vincent as they
passes each other in the front office, one goin&#8217;
out and the other comin&#8217; in.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d never happened to see &#8217;em meet before,
and I&#8217;m some surprised that they&#8217;re so well acquainted.
Don&#8217;t know why, either, unless it is
that they&#8217;re so different. Rodney, you know,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
is one of these light complected heavyweights,
and a swell because he was born so. I was wonderin&#8217;
if Rodney was one of Vincent&#8217;s lawyers,
or if they just belonged to the same clubs;
when Mr. Kipp swings on his heel and says:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, by the way, Vincent, how is grammy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; says Vincent, &#8220;isn&#8217;t she out with
you and Nellie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says Rodney, &#8220;she stayed with us
only for a couple of days. Nellie said she
hadn&#8217;t heard from her for nearly two months,
and told me to ask you about her. So long.
I&#8217;m due for some medicine ball work,&#8221; and
with that he drifts into the gym. and shuts the
door.</p>
<p>Vincent, he stands lookin&#8217; after him with a
kind of worried look on his face that was
comical to see on such a cocksure chap as
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lost somebody, have you?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; says Vincent,
runnin&#8217; his fingers through the bristles that
waves above his noble brow. &#8220;It&#8217;s grandmother.
I can&#8217;t imagine where she can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have grandmothers to burn,&#8221;
says I, &#8220;if they&#8217;re so plenty with you that you
can mislay one now and then without missin&#8217;
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says he. &#8220;No, no! She is really
my mother, you know. I&#8217;ve got into the way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
of calling her grammy only during the last
three or four years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see!&#8221; says I. &#8220;The grandmother
habit is something she&#8217;s contracted comparative
recent, eh? Ain&#8217;t gone to her head, has
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Vincent couldn&#8217;t say; but by the time he&#8217;s
quit tryin&#8217; to explain what has happened I&#8217;ve
got the whole story. First off he points out
that Rodney Kipp, havin&#8217; married his sister
Nellie, is his brother-in-law, and, as they both
have a couple of youngsters, it makes Vincent&#8217;s
mother a grammy in both families.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I know how that works
out. She stays part of the time with you, and
makes herself mighty popular with your kids;
then she takes her trunk over to Rodney&#8217;s and
goes through the same performance there. And
when she goes visitin&#8217; other places there&#8217;s a
great howl all round. That&#8217;s it, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>It wa&#8217;n&#8217;t, not within a mile, and I&#8217;d showed
up my low, common breedin&#8217; by suggesting such
a thing. As gently as he could without hurtin&#8217;
my feelin&#8217;s too much, Vincent explains that
while my programme might be strictly camel&#8217;s
foot for ordinary people, the domestic arrangements
of the upper classes was run on different
lines. For instance, his little Algernon
Chetwood could speak nothing but French, that
bein&#8217; the brand of governess he&#8217;d always had,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
and so he naturally couldn&#8217;t be very thick with
a grandmother that didn&#8217;t understand a word
of his lingo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; says Vincent, &#8220;mother and my
wife, I regret to say, have never found each
other very congenial.&#8221;</p>
<p>I might have guessed it if I&#8217;d stopped to
think of how an old lady from the country would
hitch with one of them high flyin&#8217; Chetwood
girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she hangs out with your sister, eh,
and does her grandmother act there?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, hardly,&#8221; says Vincent, colorin&#8217; up a
little. &#8220;You see, Rodney has never been very
intimate with the rest of our family. He&#8217;s a
Kipp, and&mdash;&mdash; Well, you can&#8217;t blame him; for
mother is rather old-fashioned. Of course,
she&#8217;s good and kind-hearted and all that; but&mdash;but
there isn&#8217;t much style about her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still sticks to the polonaise of &#8217;81, and
wears a straw lid she bought durin&#8217; the Centennial,
eh?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>Vincent says that about tells the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;And where is it she&#8217;s been livin&#8217; all this
time that you&#8217;ve been gettin&#8217; on so well in New
York?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our old home, Tonawanda,&#8221; says he,
shudderin&#8217; some as he lets go of the name.
&#8220;It&#8217;s where she should have stayed, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So-o-o-o?&#8221; says I. I&#8217;d been listenin&#8217; just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
out of politeness up to that point; but from then
on I got int&#8217;rested, and I don&#8217;t let up until I&#8217;ve
pumped out of him all the details about just how
much of a nuisance an old, back number mother
could be to a couple of ambitious young folks
that had grown up and married into the swell
mob.</p>
<p>It was a case that ought to be held up as a
warnin&#8217; to lots of superfluous old mothers that
ain&#8217;t got any better taste than to keep on livin&#8217;
long after there&#8217;s any use for &#8217;em. Mother
Vincent hadn&#8217;t made much trouble at first, for
she&#8217;d had an old maid sister to take care of;
but when a bad case of the grip got Aunt
Sophrony durin&#8217; the previous winter, mother
was left sort of floatin&#8217; around.</p>
<p>She tried visitin&#8217; back and forth between Vincent
and Nellie just one consecutive trip, and
the experiment was such a frost that it caused
ructions in both families. In her Tonawanda
regalia mother wa&#8217;n&#8217;t an exhibit that any English
butler could be expected to pass the soup
to and still keep a straight face.</p>
<p>So Vincent thinks it&#8217;s time to anchor her permanent
somewhere. Accordin&#8217; to his notion, he
did the handsome thing too. He buys her a
nice little farm about a mile outside of Tonawanda,
a place with a fine view of the railroad
tracks on the west and a row of brick yards to
the east, and he lands mother there with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
toothless old German housekeeper for company.
He tells her he&#8217;s settled a good comfortable income
on her for life, and leaves her to enjoy
herself.</p>
<p>But look at the ingratitude a parent can work
up! She ain&#8217;t been there more&#8217;n a couple of
months before she begins complainin&#8217; about
bein&#8217; lonesome. She don&#8217;t see much of the
Tonawanda folks now, the housekeeper ain&#8217;t
very sociable, the smoke from the brick yards
yellows her Monday wash, and the people she
sees goin&#8217; by in the cars is all strangers.
Couldn&#8217;t Vincent swap the farm for one near
New York? She liked the looks of the place
when she was there, and wouldn&#8217;t mind being
closer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that was out of the
question!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure!&#8221; says I. &#8220;How absurd! But
what&#8217;s the contents of this late bulletin about
her being a stray?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was nothing more or less than that the
old girl had sold up the farm a couple of months
back, fired the housekeeper, and quietly skipped
for New York. Vincent had looked for her to
show up at his house, and when she didn&#8217;t he
figured she must have gone to Nellie&#8217;s. It was
only when Rodney Kipp fires the grammy question
at him that he sees he&#8217;s made a wrong
calculation and begins havin&#8217; cold feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If she&#8217;s here, alone in New York, there&#8217;s
no knowing what may be happening to her,&#8221;
says he. &#8220;Why, she knows nothing about the
city, nothing at all! She might get run over,
or fall in with disreputable people, or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
The other pictures was so horrible he passes
&#8217;em up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mothers must be a great care,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t had one for so long I can&#8217;t say on my own
hook; but I judge that you and sister has had
a hard time of it with yours. Excuse me,
though, if I don&#8217;t shed any tears of sympathy,
Vincent.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looks at me kind of sharp at that; but
he&#8217;s too busy with disturbin&#8217; thoughts to ask
what I mean. Maybe he&#8217;d found out if he had.
It&#8217;s just as well he didn&#8217;t; for I was some curious
to see what would be his next move. From
his talk it&#8217;s plain Vincent is most worried
about the chances of the old lady&#8217;s doin&#8217; something
that would get her name into the papers,
and he says right off that he won&#8217;t rest easy
until he&#8217;s found her and shooed her back to the
fields.</p>
<p>&#8220;But where am I to look first?&#8221; says he.
&#8220;How am I to begin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big town to haul a dragnet through,
that&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you call in
Brother-in-Law Rodney, for a starter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; says Vincent, glancin&#8217; uneasy at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
the gym. door. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care to have him
know anything about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe sister might have some information,&#8221;
says I. &#8220;There&#8217;s the &#8217;phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; says he. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind, I
will call her up at the Kipp country place.&#8221;</p>
<p>He does; but Nellie ain&#8217;t heard a word from
mother; thought she must be with Vincent all
this time; and has been too busy givin&#8217; house
parties to find out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have her cross examine the maids,&#8221; says I.
&#8220;The old lady may have left some orders about
forwardin&#8217; her mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the clew. Inside of ten minutes
Nellie &#8217;phones back and gives a number on West
21st-st.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; says I. &#8220;A hamfatters&#8217; boardin&#8217;-house,
I&#8217;ll bet a bag of beans! Grandmother
has sure picked out a lively lodgin&#8217;-place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Horrible!&#8221; says Vincent. &#8220;I must get her
away from there at once. But I wish there was
someone who&mdash;&mdash;Shorty, could I get you to
go along with me and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rescuin&#8217; grandmothers ain&#8217;t my long suit,&#8221;
says I; &#8220;but I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;m some int&#8217;rested in
this case. Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the time our clockwork cab fetches up in
front of the prunery it&#8217;s after six o&#8217;clock.
There&#8217;s no mistakin&#8217; the sort of histrionic asylum
it was, either. A hungry lookin&#8217; bunch of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
actorets was lined up on the front steps, everyone
of &#8217;em with an ear stretched out for the
dinner bell. In the window of the first floor
front was a beauty doctor&#8217;s sign, a bull fiddle-artist
was sawin&#8217; out his soul distress in the
hall bedroom above, and up under the cornice
the Chicini sisters was leanin&#8217; on the ledge and
wishin&#8217; the folks back in Saginaw would send on
that grubstake letter before the landlady got
any worse. But maybe you&#8217;ve seen samples
of real dogday tragedy among the profesh, when
the summer snaps have busted and the fall rehearsals
have just begun. What, Mabel?</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sure enough double-in-brass roost,&#8221;
says I. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say anything that sounds like
contract, or you&#8217;ll be mobbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>But they sizes Vincent up for a real estate
broker, and gives him the chilly stare, until he
mentions the old lady&#8217;s name. Then they thaws
out sudden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the Duchess!&#8221; squeals a couple in
chorus. &#8220;Why, she always dines out, you
know. You&#8217;ll find her around at Doughretti&#8217;s,
on 27th-st.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Duchess!&#8221; says Vincent. &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid
there&#8217;s some mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; says one of the crowd. &#8220;We
all call her that. She&#8217;s got Little Spring Water
with her to-night. Doughretti&#8217;s, just in from
the avenue, is the place.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>And Vincent is the worst puzzled gent you
ever saw as he climbs back into the cab.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be mother they mean,&#8221; says he.
&#8220;No one would ever think of calling her
Duchess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no accountin&#8217; for what them actorines
would do,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Anyway, all you got
to do is take a peek at the party, and if it&#8217;s
a wrong steer we can go back and take a fresh
start.&#8221;</p>
<p>You know Doughretti&#8217;s, if you don&#8217;t you
know a dozen just like it. It&#8217;s one of these
sixty-cent table dotty joints, with an electric
name sign, a striped stoop awnin&#8217;, and a seven-course
menu manifolded in pale purple ink. You
begin the agony with an imitation soup that
looks like Rockaway beach water when the
tide&#8217;s comin&#8217; in, and you end with a choice of
petrified cheese rinds that might pass for souvenirs
from the Palisades.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to taste what you eat, you
let &#8217;em hand you a free bottle of pure California
claret, vatted on East Houston-st. It&#8217;s
a mixture of filtered Croton, extra quality aniline
dyes, and two kinds of wood alcohol, and
after you&#8217;ve had a pint of it you don&#8217;t care
whether the milk fed Philadelphia chicken was
put in cold storage last winter, or back in the
year of the big wind.</p>
<p>Madam Doughretti had just fed the Punk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
Lady waltz into the pianola for the fourth time
as we pulls up at the curb.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use,&#8221; says Vincent. &#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t
be here. I will wait, though, while you take a
look around; if you will, Shorty.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the way over he&#8217;s given me a description
of his missin&#8217; parent; so I pikes up the steps,
pushes past the garlic smells, and proceeds to
inspect the groups around the little tables.
What I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; for is a squatty old party with
gray hair pasted down over her ears, and a
waist like a bag of hay tied in the middle. She&#8217;s
supposed to be wearin&#8217; a string bonnet about
the size of a saucer, with a bunch of faded velvet
violets on top, a coral brooch at her neck,
and either a black alpaca or a lavender sprigged
grenadine. Most likely, too, she&#8217;ll be doin&#8217; the
shovel act with her knife.</p>
<p>Well, there was a good many kinds of females
scattered around the coffee stained tablecloths,
but none that answers to these specifications.
I was just gettin&#8217; ready to call off the search,
when I gets my eye on a couple over in one
corner. The gent was one of these studio Indians,
with his hair tucked inside his collar.</p>
<p>The old girl facin&#8217; him didn&#8217;t have any Tonawanda
look about her, though. She was what
you might call a frosted pippin, a reg&#8217;lar
dowager dazzler, like the pictures you see on
fans. Her gray hair has been spliced out with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
store puffs until it looks like a weddin&#8217; cake;
her hat is one of the new wash basin models,
covered with pink roses that just matches the
color of her cheeks; and her peek-a-poo lace dress
fits her like it had been put onto her with a
shoe horn.</p>
<p>Sure, I wa&#8217;n&#8217;t lookin&#8217; for any such party as
this; but I can&#8217;t help takin&#8217; a second squint.
I notices what fine, gentle old eyes she has, and
while I was doin&#8217; that I spots something else.
Just under her chin is one of them antique
coral pins. Course, it looked like a long shot,
but I steps out to the door and motions Vincent
to come in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect we&#8217;re way off the track,&#8221; says I;
&#8220;but I&#8217;d like to have you take a careless glance
at the giddy old party over under the kummel
sign in the corner; the one facin&#8217; this way&mdash;there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vincent gives a jump at the first look. Then
he starts for her full tilt, me trailin&#8217; along and
whisperin&#8217; to him not to make any fool break
unless he&#8217;s dead sure. But there&#8217;s no holdin&#8217;
him back. She&#8217;s so busy chattin&#8217; with the reformed
Sioux in store clothes that she don&#8217;t
notice Vincent until he&#8217;s right alongside, and
just as she looks up he lets loose his indignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, grandmother!&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>She don&#8217;t seem so much jarred as you might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
think. She don&#8217;t even drop the fork that she&#8217;s
usin&#8217; to twist up a gob of spaghetti on. All
she does is to lift her eyebrows in a kind of
annoyed way, and shoot a quick look at the
copper tinted gent across the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, Vincent?&#8221; says she. &#8220;Please
don&#8217;t grandmother me; at least, not in public.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; says he, &#8220;you know that you are a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I admit nothing of the kind,&#8221; says she.
&#8220;I may be your mother; but as for being anybody&#8217;s
grandmother, that is an experience I
know nothing about. Now please run along,
Vincent, and don&#8217;t bother.&#8221;</p>
<p>That leaves Vincent up in the air for keeps.
He don&#8217;t know what to make of this reception,
or of the change that happened to her; but he
feels he ought to register some sort of a
kick.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, mother,&#8221; says he, &#8220;what does this
mean? Such clothes! And such&mdash;such&#8221;&mdash;here
he throws a meanin&#8217; look at the Indian
gent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allow me,&#8221; says grandmother, breakin&#8217; in
real dignified, &#8220;to introduce Mr. John Little
Bear, son of Chief Won-go-plunki. I am very
sorry to interrupt our talk on art, John; but I
suppose I must say a few words to Vincent.
Would you mind taking your coffee on the back
veranda?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>He was a well-trained red man, John was,
and he understands the back out sign; so inside
of a minute the crockery has been pushed
away and I&#8217;m attendin&#8217; a family reunion that
appears to be cast on new lines. Vincent begins
again by askin&#8217; what it all means.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means, Vincent,&#8221; says she, &#8220;that I have
caught up with the procession. I tried being
the old-fashioned kind of grandmother, and I
wasn&#8217;t a success. Now I&#8217;m learning the new
way, and I like it first rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But your&mdash;your clothes!&#8221; gasps Vincent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what of them?&#8221; says she. &#8220;You
made fun of the ones I used to wear; but these,
I would have you know, were selected for me by
a committee of six chorus ladies who know
what is what. I am quite satisfied with my
clothes, Vincent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly they&#8217;re all right,&#8221; says he; &#8220;but
how&mdash;how long have you been wearing your
hair that way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever since Madam Montrosini started on
my improvement course,&#8221; says she. &#8220;I am
told it is quite becoming. And have you noticed
my new waist line, Vincent?&#8221;</p>
<p>Vincent hadn&#8217;t; but he did then, and he had
nothin&#8217; to say, for she has an hourglass lookin&#8217;
like a hitchin&#8217; post. Not bein&#8217; able to carry
on the debate under them headings, he switches
and comes out strong on what an awful thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
it was for her to be livin&#8217; among such dreadful
people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; says grandmother, &#8220;they&#8217;re real
nice, I&#8217;m sure. They have been just as good to
me as they could be. They take turns going out
to dinner with me and showing me around the
town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; says Vincent. &#8220;And this&mdash;this
Bear person, does he&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is an educated, full blooded Sioux,&#8221;
says grandmother. &#8220;He has toured Europe
with Buffalo Bill, and just now he is an artists&#8217;
model. He is very entertaining company,
Johnny is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Johnny!&#8221; gasps Vincent under his breath.
That&#8217;s the last straw. He lays down the law
then and there to grandmother. If she ever expects
him to recognize her again, she must
shake this whole crowd and come with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where to, Vincent?&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, to my home, of course,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;And have your wife&#8217;s maid speak of me
as a dumpy old scarecrow? No, thank you!&#8221;
and she calls the waiter to bring a demitasse
with cognac.</p>
<p>&#8220;But no one could call you that now,
mother,&#8221; says Vincent. &#8220;You&mdash;you&#8217;re different,
quite different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, am I?&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure you are,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Julia and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
I would be glad to have you with us. Really,
we would.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was a good natured old girl, grandmother
was. She says she&#8217;ll try it; but only on one
condition. It was a corker, too. If she&#8217;s going
to give all her good friends at the actors&#8217;
boardin&#8217; house the shake, she thinks it ought
to be done at a farewell dinner at the swellest
place in town. Vincent groans; but he has to
give in. And that&#8217;s how it happens the other
night that about two dozen liberty people walked
up from Appetite Row and fed themselves off
Sherry&#8217;s gold plates until the waiters was weak
in the knees watchin&#8217; &#8217;em.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the old lady still leadin&#8217; the band
wagon, Vincent!&#8221; says I to him yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is,&#8221; says he, &#8220;and it is wonderful how
young she has grown.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;New York is a great place for rejuvenatin&#8217;
grandmothers,&#8221; says I, &#8220;specially around in
the Red Ink Zone.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A LONG SHOT ON DELANCEY</h3>
</div>

<p>Well, I&#8217;ve been slummin&#8217; up again. It happens
like this: I was just preparin&#8217;, here the
other noontime, to rush around the corner and
destroy a plate of lunch counter hash decorated
with parsley and a dropped egg, when I gets
this &#8217;phone call from Duke Borden, who says
he wants to see me the worst way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says I, &#8220;the studio&#8217;s still here on
42d-st., and if your eyesight ain&#8217;t failed
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, chop it, can&#8217;t you, Shorty?&#8221; says he.
&#8220;This is really important. Come right up,
can&#8217;t you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Any partic&#8217;lar
place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Here at the club.
I&#8217;m to meet Chick Sommers here in half an
hour. We&#8217;ll have luncheon together and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know Chick;
but I&#8217;m a mixer, and I&#8217;ll stand for anything in
the food line but cold egg. Scratch the chilled
hen fruit and I&#8217;m with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Know about Duke, don&#8217;t you? It ain&#8217;t much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
to tell. He&#8217;s just one of these big, handsome,
overfed chappies that help the mounted traffic
cops to make Fifth-ave. look different from
other Main-sts. He don&#8217;t do any special good,
or any partic&#8217;lar harm. Duke&#8217;s got just enough
sense, though, to have spasms of thinkin&#8217; he
wants to do something useful now and then,
and all I can dope out of this emergency call
of his is that this is a new thought.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the answer, too. He begins tellin&#8217; me
about it while the head waiter&#8217;s leadin&#8217; us over
to a corner table. Oh, yes, he&#8217;s going in for
business in dead earnest now, y&#8217;know,&mdash;suite
of offices, his name on the letterheads, and all
that sort of thing, bah Jove!</p>
<p>All of which means that Mr. Chick Sommers,
who was a star quarterback in &#8217;05, when Duke
was makin&#8217; his college bluff on the Gold Coast,
has rung him into a South Jersey land boomin&#8217;
scheme. A few others, friends of Chick&#8217;s, are
in it. They&#8217;re all rippin&#8217; good fellows, too,
and awfully clever at planning out things.
Chick himself, of course, is a corker. It was
him that insisted on Duke&#8217;s bein&#8217; treasurer.</p>
<p>&#8220;And really,&#8221; says Duke, &#8220;about all I have
to do is drop around once or twice a week and
sign a few checks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; says I. &#8220;They let you supply the
funds, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; says Duke. &#8220;I&#8217;m the only one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
who can, y&#8217;know. But they depend a great
deal on my judgment, too. For instance, take
this new deal that&#8217;s on; it has all been left to
me. There are one hundred and eighteen acres,
and we don&#8217;t buy a foot unless I say so. That&#8217;s
where you come in, Shorty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do I?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; Duke goes on, &#8220;I&#8217;m supposed to
inspect it and make a decision before the option
expires, which will be day after to-morrow.
The fact is, I&#8217;ve been putting off going
down there, and now I find I&#8217;ve a winter house
party on, up in Lenox, and&mdash;&mdash; Well, you see
the box I&#8217;m in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; says I. &#8220;You want me to sub for
you at Lenox?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Deuce take it, no!&#8221; says Duke. &#8220;I want
you to go down and look at that land for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; says I. &#8220;What I know about real
estate wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; says Duke. &#8220;It&#8217;s
only a matter of form. The boys say they
want it, and I&#8217;m going to buy it for them anyway;
but, just to have it all straight and businesslike,
either I ought to see the land myself,
or have it inspected by my personal representative.
Understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Duke,&#8221; says I, &#8220;you&#8217;re a reg&#8217;lar real
estate Napoleon. I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it
was in you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I&#8217;m really surprised
at myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next he explains how he happened to think of
sendin&#8217; me, and casually he wants to know if a
couple of hundred and expenses will be about
right for spoilin&#8217; two days of my valuable time.
How could I tell how much it would lose me?
But I said I&#8217;d run the chances.</p>
<p>Then Chick shows up, and they begin to talk
over the details of this new bungalow boom
town that&#8217;s to be located on the Jersey side.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you,&#8221; says Chick, &#8220;it&#8217;ll be a winner
from the start. Why, there&#8217;s every advantage
anyone could wish for,&mdash;ocean breezes mingled
with pine scented zephyrs, magnificent views,
and a railroad running right through the property!
The nearest station now is Clam Creek;
but we&#8217;ll have one of our own, with a new name.
Clam Creek! Ugh! How does Pinemere strike
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly ripping, by Jove!&#8221; says Duke, so
excited over it that he lights the cork end of his
cigarette. &#8220;Shorty, you must go right down
there for me. Can&#8217;t you start as soon as you&#8217;ve
had your coffee?&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, but it was thrillin&#8217;, listenin&#8217; to them two
amateur real estaters layin&#8217; plans that was to
make a seashore wilderness blossom with surveyors&#8217;
stakes and fresh painted signs like
Belvidere-ave., Ozone Boulevard, and so on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>It struck me, though, that they was discussin&#8217;
their scheme kind of free and public. I spots
one white haired, dignified old boy, doing the
solitaire feed at the table back of Duke, who
seems more or less int&#8217;rested. And I notices
that every time Clam Creek is mentioned he
pricks up his ears. Sure enough, too, just as
we&#8217;re finishing, he steps over and taps Duke
on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, howdy do, Mr. Cathaway?&#8221; says
Duke. &#8220;Charmed to see you, by Jove!&#8221;</p>
<p>And it turns out he&#8217;s DeLancey Cathaway,
the big noise in the philanthropy game, him
that gets up societies for suppressin&#8217; the poor
and has his name on hospitals and iron drinkin&#8217;
fountains. After he&#8217;s been introduced all
around he admits that he&#8217;s caught one or two
remarks, and says he wants to congratulate
Duke on givin&#8217; up his idle ways and breakin&#8217;
into an active career.</p>
<p>Oh, he&#8217;s a smooth old party, Mr. Cathaway
is! He don&#8217;t let on to be more&#8217;n moderately
int&#8217;rested, and the next thing I know he&#8217;s sidled
away from Duke and is walkin&#8217; out alongside
of me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going down town?&#8221; says he. &#8220;Then perhaps
you will allow me to give you a lift?&#8221; and
he motions to his town car waiting at the curb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; thinks I. &#8220;I&#8217;m makin&#8217; a hit with
the nobility, me and my winnin&#8217; ways!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>That don&#8217;t exactly state the case, though;
for as soon as we&#8217;re alone DeLancey comes
right to cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand, Mr. McCabe,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that
you are to visit Clam Creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Sounds enticin&#8217;, don&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doubtless you will spend a day or so
there?&#8221; he goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over night, anyway,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum!&#8221; says he. &#8220;Then you will hardly
fail to meet my brother. He is living at Clam
Creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Not Broadway Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; says he, &#8220;Robert and his wife have
been there for nearly two years. At least, that
is where I have been sending his allowance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Bob too!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Why&mdash;why, say,
you don&#8217;t mean the one that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same,&#8221; he cuts in. &#8220;I know they&#8217;re
supposed to be abroad; but they&#8217;re not, they are
at Clam Creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;ve heard about the Bob Cathaways,
and maybe you ain&#8217;t. There&#8217;s so many
new near-plutes nowadays that the old families
ain&#8217;t getting the advertisin&#8217; they&#8217;ve been
used to. Anyway, it&#8217;s been sometime since
Broadway Bob had his share of the limelight.
You see, Bob sort of had his day when he was
along in his thirties, and they say he was a real
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
old-time sport and rounder, which was why he
was let in so bad when old man Cathaway&#8217;s will
was probated. All Bob pulls out is a couple of
thousand a year, even that being handled first
by Brother DeLancey, who cops all the rest of
the pile as a reward for always having gone in
strong for charity and the perfectly good life.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a case where virtue shows up strong from
the first tap of the bell. Course, Bob can look
back on some years of vivid joy, when he was
makin&#8217; a record as a quart opener, buyin&#8217; stacks
of blues at Daly&#8217;s, or over at Monte Carlo bettin&#8217;
where the ball would stop. But all this
ends mighty abrupt.</p>
<p>In the meantime Bob has married a lively
young lady that nobody knew much about except
that she was almost as good a sport as he
was, and they were doin&#8217; some great teamwork
in the way of livenin&#8217; up society, when the
crash came.</p>
<p>Then it was the noble hearted DeLancey to
the rescue. He don&#8217;t exactly take them right
into the fam&#8217;ly; but he sends Mr. and Mrs. Bob
over to his big Long Island country place, assigns
&#8217;em quarters in the north wing, and advises
&#8217;em to be as happy as they can. Now to
most folks that would look like landin&#8217; on Velveteen-st.,&mdash;free
eats, no room rent, and a forty-acre
park to roam around in, with the use of a
couple of safe horses and a libr&#8217;y full of improvin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
books, such as the Rollo series and the
works of Dr. Van Dyke.</p>
<p>Brother Bob don&#8217;t squeal or whine. He
starts in to make the best of it by riggin&#8217; himself
out like an English Squire and makin&#8217; a
stagger at the country gentleman act. He takes
a real int&#8217;rest in keepin&#8217; up the grounds and
managin&#8217; the help, which DeLancey had never
been able to do himself.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as dull as dishwater, though, for Mrs.
Robert Cathaway, and as there ain&#8217;t anyone
else handy she takes it out on Bob. Accordin&#8217;
to all accounts, they must have done the anvil
chorus good and plenty. You can just see how
it would be, with them two dumped down so far
from Broadway and only now and then comp&#8217;ny
to break the monotony. When people did come,
too, they was DeLancey&#8217;s kind. I can picture
Bob tryin&#8217; to get chummy with a bunch of prison
reformers or delegates to a Sunday school
union. I don&#8217;t wonder his disposition curdled
up.</p>
<p>If it hadn&#8217;t been for Mrs. Bob, though, they&#8217;d
been there yet. She got so used to rowin&#8217; with
Bob that she kept it up even when Brother DeLancey
and his friends came down. DeLancey
stands for it until one morning at breakfast,
when he was entertainin&#8217; an English Bishop
he&#8217;d corraled at some conference. Him and
the Bishop was exchangin&#8217; views on whether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
free soup and free salvation was a good workin&#8217;
combination or not, when some little thing sets
Mr. and Mrs. Bob to naggin&#8217; each other on the
side. I forgot just what it was Bob shot over;
but after standin&#8217; her jabs for quite some time
without gettin&#8217; real personal he comes back
with some stage whisper remark that cut in
deep.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bob was right in the act of helpin&#8217; herself
to the jelly omelet, usin&#8217; a swell silver
servin&#8217; shovel about half the size of a brick
layer&#8217;s trowel. She&#8217;s so stirred up that she absentmindedly
scoops up a double portion, and
just as Bob springs his remark what does she do
but up and let fly at him, right across the table.
Maybe she&#8217;d have winged him too,&mdash;and served
him right for saying what no gentleman should
to a lady, even if she is his wife,&mdash;but, what
with her not stoppin&#8217; to take good aim, and the
maid&#8217;s gettin&#8217; her tray against her elbow, she
misses Bob by about three feet and plasters the
English Bishop square between the eyes.</p>
<p>Now of course that wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any way to serve
hot omelet to a stranger, no matter how annoyed
you was. DeLancey told her as much
while he was helpin&#8217; swab off the reverend guest.
Afterwards he added other observations more
or less definite. Inside of two hours Mr. and
Mrs. Bob found their baggage waitin&#8217; under the
porte cochère, and the wagonette ready to take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
&#8217;em to the noon train. They went. It was
given out that they was travelin&#8217; abroad, and
if it hadn&#8217;t been for the omelet part of the
incident they&#8217;d been forgotten long ago. That
was a stunt that stuck, though.</p>
<p>As I looks at DeLancey there in the limousine
I has to grin. &#8220;Say,&#8221; says I, &#8220;was it a fact
that the Bishop broke loose and cussed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That humiliating affair, Mr. McCabe,&#8221; says
he, &#8220;I would much prefer not to talk about.
I refer to my brother now because, knowing
that you are going to Clam Creek, you will probably
meet him there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Like to have me give him
your best regards!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says DeLancey. &#8220;I should like, however,
to hear how you found him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another report, eh!&#8221; says I. &#8220;All right,
Mr. Cathaway, I&#8217;ll size him up for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But chiefly,&#8221; he goes on, &#8220;I shall depend
upon your discretion not to mention my
brother&#8217;s whereabouts to anyone else. As an
aid to that discretion,&#8221; says he, digging up his
roll and sortin&#8217; out some tens, &#8220;I am prepared
to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, button &#8217;em back!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Who do
you think you&#8217;re dealin&#8217; with, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; says he, flushin&#8217; up, &#8220;I merely intended&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, forget it!&#8221; says I. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t runnin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
any opposition to the Black Hand, and as for
whether I leak out where your brother is or
not, that&#8217;s something you got to take chances
on. Pull up there, Mr. Chauffeur! This is
where I start to walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>And say, you could put his name on all the
hospitals and orphan asylums in the country;
but I never could see it again without growin&#8217;
warm under the collar. Bah! Some of these
perfectly good folks have a habit of gettin&#8217; on
my nerves. All the way down to Clam Creek
I kept tryin&#8217; to wipe him off the slate, and I&#8217;d
made up my mind to dodge Brother Bob, if I
had to sleep in the woods.</p>
<p>So as soon as I hops off the train I gets my
directions and starts to tramp over this tract
that Duke Borden was plannin&#8217; on blowin&#8217; some
of his surplus cash against. And say, if anybody
wants an imitation desert, dotted with
scrub pine and fringed with salt marshes, that&#8217;s
the place to go lookin&#8217; for it. There&#8217;s hundreds
of square miles of it down there that nobody&#8217;s
usin&#8217;, or threatenin&#8217; to.</p>
<p>Also I walked up an appetite like a fresh
landed hired girl. I was so hungry that I pikes
straight for the only hotel and begs &#8217;em to lead
me to a knife and fork. For a wonder, too,
they brings on some real food, plain and hearty,
and I don&#8217;t worry about the way it&#8217;s thrown at
me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>Yon know how it is out in the kerosene district.
I finds myself face to face with a hunk
of corned beef as big as my two fists, boiled
Murphies, cabbage and canned corn on the side,
bread sliced an inch thick, and spring freshet
coffee in a cup you couldn&#8217;t break with an ax.
Lizzie, the waitress, was chewin&#8217; gum and
watchin&#8217; to see if I was one of them fresh travelin&#8217;
gents that would try any funny cracks
on her.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d waded through the food programme as
far as makin&#8217; a choice between tapioca puddin&#8217;
and canned peaches, when in drifts a couple that
I knew, the minute I gets my eyes on &#8217;em, must
be Mr. and Mrs. Bob Cathaway. Who else in
that little one-horse town would be sportin&#8217; a
pair of puttee leggin&#8217;s and doeskin ridin&#8217;
breeches? That was Bob&#8217;s makeup, includin&#8217;
a flap-pocketed cutaway of Harris tweed and a
corduroy vest. They fit him a little snug,
showin&#8217; he&#8217;s laid on some flesh since he had &#8217;em
built. Also he&#8217;s a lot grayer than I expected,
knowin&#8217; him to be younger than DeLancey.</p>
<p>As for Mrs. Bob&mdash;well, if you can remember
how the women was dressin&#8217; as far back as two
years ago, and can throw on the screen a picture
of a woman who has only the reminders
of her good looks left, you&#8217;ll have her framed
up. A pair of seedy thoroughbreds, they was,
seedy and down and out.</p>

&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>I knew it must be Mr. and Mrs. Bob Cathaway</span>&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>I was wonderin&#8217; if they still indulged in them
lively fam&#8217;ly debates, and how soon I&#8217;d have to
begin dodgin&#8217; dishes; but they sits down across
the table from me and hardly swaps a word.
All I notices is the scornful way Lizzie asks
if they&#8217;ll have soup, and the tremble to Bob
Cathaway&#8217;s hand as he lifts his water tumbler.</p>
<p>As there was only us three in the room, and
as none of us seemed to have anything to say,
it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t what you might call a boisterous assemblage.
While I was waitin&#8217; for dessert I
put in the time gazin&#8217; around at the scenery,
from the moldy pickle jars at either end of the
table, over to the walnut sideboard where they
kept the plated cake basket and the ketchup
bottles, across to the framed fruit piece that
had seen so many hard fly seasons, and up to
the smoky ceilin&#8217;. I looked everywhere except
at the pair opposite.</p>
<p>Lizzie was balancin&#8217; the soup plates on her
left arm and singsongin&#8217; the bill of fare to &#8217;em.
&#8220;Col&#8217;-pork-col&#8217;-ham-an&#8217;-corn-beef-&#8217;n&#8217;-cabbage,&#8221;
says she.</p>
<p>If Bob Cathaway didn&#8217;t shudder at that, I
did for him. &#8220;You may bring me&mdash;er&mdash;some
of the latter,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>I tested the canned peaches and then took
a sneak. On one side of the front hall was the
hotel parlor, full of plush furniture and stuffed
birds. The office and bar was on the other. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
strolls in where half a dozen Clam Creekers was
sittin&#8217; around a big sawdust box indulgin&#8217;
in target practice; but after a couple of
sniffs I concludes that the breathin&#8217; air is all
outside.</p>
<p>After half an hour&#8217;s stroll I goes in, takes a
lamp off the hall table, and climbs up to No. 7.
It&#8217;s as warm and cheerful as an underground
beer vault. Also I finds the window nailed
down. Huntin&#8217; for someone to fetch me a
hammer was what sent me roamin&#8217; through the
hall and took me past No. 11, where the door
was part way open. And in there, with an oil-stove
to keep &#8217;em from freezin&#8217;, I see Mr. and
Mrs. Bob Cathaway sittin&#8217; at a little marble
topped table playin&#8217; double dummy bridge. Say,
do you know, that unexpected glimpse of this
little private hard luck proposition of theirs
kind of got me in the short ribs. And next
thing I knew I had my head in the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the love of Mike,&#8221; says I, &#8220;how do
you stand it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says Bob, droppin&#8217; his cards and
starin&#8217; at me. &#8220;I&mdash;I beg pardon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, with that I steps in, tells him who I
am, and how I&#8217;d just had a talk with Brother
DeLancey. Do I get the glad hand? Why,
you&#8217;d thought I was a blooming he angel
come straight from the pearly gates. Bob
drags me in, pushes me into the only rocker in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
the room, shoves a cigar box at me, and begins
to haul decanters from under the washstand.
They both asks questions at once. How is
everybody, and who&#8217;s married who, and are so
and so still living together?</p>
<p>I reels off society gossip for an hour before
I gets a chance to do some pumpin&#8217; on my own
hook. What I wants to know is why in blazes
they&#8217;re hidin&#8217; in a hole like Clam Creek.</p>
<p>Bob only shrugs his shoulders. &#8220;Why not
here as well as anywhere?&#8221; says he. &#8220;When
you can&#8217;t afford to live among your friends,
why&mdash;you live in Clam Creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But two years of it!&#8221; says I. &#8220;What do
you find to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we manage,&#8221; says he, wavin&#8217; at the
double dummy outfit. &#8220;Babe and I have our
little game. It&#8217;s only for a dime a point; but
it helps pass away the time. You see, when
our monthly allowance comes in we divide it
equally and take a fresh start. The winner has
the privilege of paying our bills.&#8221;</p>
<p>How was that for excitement? And Bob
whispers to me, as we starts out for a little
walk before turnin&#8217; in, &#8220;I generally fix it so
Babe&mdash;er, Mrs. Cathaway&mdash;can win, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>From other little hints I gathers that their
stay in Clam Creek has done one thing for &#8217;em,
anyway. It had put &#8217;em wise to the great fact
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
that the best way for two parties to get along
together is to cut out the hammer music.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you had a talk with DeLancey?&#8221; says
Bob on the way back. &#8220;I suppose he&mdash;er&mdash;sent
no message?&#8221;</p>
<p>It had taken Bob Cathaway all this while to
work up to that question, and he can&#8217;t steady
down his voice as he puts it. And that quaver
tells me the whole story of how he&#8217;s been hoping
all along that Brother DeLancey would
sometime or other get over his grouch. Which
puts it up to me to tell him what a human iceberg
he&#8217;s related to. Did I? Honest, there&#8217;s
times when I ain&#8217;t got much use for the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Message?&#8221; says I, prompt and cheerful.
&#8220;Now what in blazes was it he did say to tell
you? Something about asking how long before
you and Mrs. Cathaway was goin&#8217; to run up and
make him a visit, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A visit!&#8221; gasps Bob. &#8220;Did&mdash;did DeLancey
say that? Then thank Heaven it&#8217;s over!
Come on! Hurry!&#8221; and he grabs me by the
arm, tows me to the hotel, and makes a dash
up the stairs towards their room.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think, Babe?&#8221; says he,
pantin&#8217;. &#8220;DeLancey wants to know when
we&#8217;re coming back!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a minute Mrs. Bob don&#8217;t say a word, but
just stands there, her hands gripped in Bob&#8217;s,
and the dew startin&#8217; out of her eye corners.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
Then she asks, sort of husky, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there a
night train, Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>There wa&#8217;n&#8217;t; but there was one at six-thirty-eight
in the mornin&#8217;. We all caught it, too, both
of &#8217;em as chipper as a pair of kids, and me wonderin&#8217;
how it was all goin&#8217; to turn out.</p>
<p>For three days after that I never went to the
&#8217;phone without expectin&#8217; to hear from Bob
Cathaway, expressin&#8217; his opinion about my
qualifications for the Ananias class. And then
here the other afternoon I runs into Brother
DeLancey on the avenue, not seein&#8217; him quick
enough to beat it up a side street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, McCabe,&#8221; he sings out, &#8220;just a moment!
That little affair about my Brother Robert,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I know,&#8221; says I, bracin&#8217; myself.
&#8220;Where is he now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; says DeLancey, with never an eyelash
flutterin&#8217;, &#8220;he and his wife are living at
Green Oaks again. Just returned from an extended
trip abroad, you know.&#8221; Then he
winks.</p>
<p>Say, who was it sent out that bulletin about
how all men was liars? I ain&#8217;t puttin&#8217; in any
not guilty plea; but I&#8217;d like to add that some
has got it down finer than others.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>PLAYING HAROLD BOTH WAYS</h3>
</div>

<p>Anyway, they came bunched, and that was
some comfort. Eh? Well, first off there was
the lovers, then there was Harold; and it was
only the combination that saved me from developin&#8217;
an ingrowin&#8217; grouch.</p>
<p>You can guess who it was accumulated the
lovers. Why, when Sadie comes back from Bar
Harbor and begins tellin&#8217; me about &#8217;em, you&#8217;d
thought she&#8217;d been left something in a will,
she&#8217;s so pleased.</p>
<p>Seems there was these two young ladies,
friends of some friends of hers, that was bein&#8217;
just as miserable as they could be up there.
One was visitin&#8217; the other, and, as I made out
from Sadie&#8217;s description, they must have been
havin&#8217; an awful time, livin&#8217; in one of them
eighteen-room cottages built on a point juttin&#8217;
a mile or so out into the ocean, with nothin&#8217; but
yachts and motor boats and saddle horses and
tennis courts and so on to amuse themselves
with.</p>
<p>I inspected some of them places when I was
up that way not long ago,&mdash;joints where they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
get their only information about hot waves by
readin&#8217; the papers,&mdash;and I can just imagine how
I could suffer puttin&#8217; in a summer there. Say,
some folks don&#8217;t know when they&#8217;re well off,
do they?</p>
<p>And what do you suppose the trouble with
&#8217;em was? Why, Bobbie and Charlie was
missin&#8217;. Honest, that&#8217;s all the place lacked to
make it a suburb of Paradise. But that was
enough for the young ladies; for each of &#8217;em
was sportin&#8217; a diamond ring on the proper
finger, and, as they confides to Sadie, what was
the use of havin&#8217; summer at all, if one&#8217;s fiancé
couldn&#8217;t be there?</p>
<p>Bobbie and Charlie, it appears, was slavin&#8217;
away in the city; one tryin&#8217; to convince Papa
that he&#8217;d be a real addition to Wall Street, and
the other trainin&#8217; with Uncle for a job as vice
president of a life insurance company. So
what did Helen and Marjorie care about sea
breezes and picture postal scenery? Once a
day they climbed out to separate perches on the
rocks to read letters from Bobbie and Charlie;
and the rest of the time they put in comparin&#8217;
notes and helpin&#8217; each other be miserable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, quit it, Sadie!&#8221; says I, interruptin&#8217; the
sad tale. &#8220;Do you want to make me cry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they were wretched, even if you don&#8217;t
believe it,&#8221; says she; &#8220;so I just told them to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
come right down here for the rest of the season.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha-a-at!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Not here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; says Sadie. &#8220;The boys can
run up every afternoon and have dinner with
us and stay over Sunday, and&mdash;and it will be
just lovely. You know how much I like to have
young people around. So do you, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know,&#8221; says she. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t
matchmaking, though. They&#8217;re already engaged,
and it will be just delightful to have them
with us. Now won&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it will,&#8221; says I. &#8220;We ain&#8217;t ever
done this wholesale before; so I ain&#8217;t sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Someway, I had a hunch that two pair of
lovers knockin&#8217; around the premises at once
might be most too much of a good thing; but,
as long as I couldn&#8217;t quote any authorities, I
didn&#8217;t feel like keepin&#8217; on with the debate.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t object any to the style of the young
ladies when they showed up; for they was both
in the queen class, tall and willowy and sweet
faced. One could tease opera airs out of the
piano in great shape, and the other had quite
some of a voice; so the prospects were for a
few weeks of lively and entertainin&#8217; evenin&#8217;s
at the McCabe mansion. I had the programme
all framed up too,&mdash;me out on the veranda with
my heels on the rail, the windows open, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
inside the young folks strikin&#8217; up the melodies
and makin&#8217; merry gen&#8217;rally.</p>
<p>Bobbie and Charles made more or less of a
hit with me too when they first called,&mdash;good,
husky, clean built young gents that passed out
the cordial grip and remarked real hearty how
much they appreciated our great kindness
askin&#8217; &#8217;em up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it,&#8221; says I. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fad of
mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyway, it looked like a good game to be in
on, seein&#8217; there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any objections from any
of the fam&#8217;lies. Made me feel bright and
chirky, just to see &#8217;em there, so that night at
dinner I cut loose with some real cute joshes
for the benefit of the young people. You know
how easy it is to be humorous on them occasions.
Honest, I must have come across with
some of the snappiest I had in stock, and I was
watchin&#8217; for the girls to pink up and accuse
me of bein&#8217; an awful kidder, when all of a
sudden I tumbles to the fact that I ain&#8217;t holdin&#8217;
my audience.</p>
<p>Say, they&#8217;d started up a couple of conversations
on their own hook&mdash;kind of side issue,
soft pedal dialogues&mdash;and they wa&#8217;n&#8217;t takin&#8217;
the slightest notice of my brilliant efforts. At
the other end of the table Sadie is havin&#8217; more
or less the same experience; for every time she
tries to cut in with some cheerful observation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
she finds she&#8217;s addressin&#8217; either Marjorie&#8217;s left
shoulder or Bobbie&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, Sadie?&#8221; says I across the centerpiece.
&#8220;What was that last of yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; says she. &#8220;Shall we
have coffee in the library, girls, or outside!
I say, Helen, shall we have&mdash;&mdash; I beg pardon,
Helen, but would you prefer&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we seem to need most, Sadie,&#8221; says
I as she gives it up, &#8220;is a table megaphone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody hears this suggestion, though, not
even Sadie. I was lookin&#8217; for the fun to begin
after dinner,&mdash;the duets and the solos and the
quartets,&mdash;but the first thing Sadie and I
know we are occupyin&#8217; the libr&#8217;y all by ourselves,
with nothing doing in the merry music
line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; says she, &#8220;they want a little
time by themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Half-hour out for the
reunion.&#8221;</p>
<p>It lasts some longer, though. At the end of
an hour I thinks I&#8217;ll put in the rest of the wait
watchin&#8217; the moon come up out of Long Island
Sound from my fav&#8217;rite corner of the veranda;
but when I gets there I finds it&#8217;s occupied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; says I, and beats it around
to the other side, where there&#8217;s a double rocker
that I can gen&#8217;rally be comfortable in. Hanged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
if I didn&#8217;t come near sittin&#8217; slam down on
the second pair, that was snuggled up close
there in the dark!</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; says I in my best comic vein. &#8220;So
here&#8217;s where you are, eh? Fine night, ain&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a snicker from the young lady, a
grunt from the young gent; but nothing else
happens in the way of a glad response. So I
chases back into the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lovely out, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; says Sadie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but more or less mushy in
spots.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that we starts in to sit up for &#8217;em.
Sadie says we got to because we&#8217;re doin&#8217; the
chaperon act. And, say, I&#8217;ve seen more excitin&#8217;
games. I read three evenin&#8217; papers clear
through from the weather forecast to the bond
quotations, and I finished by goin&#8217; sound asleep
in my chair. I don&#8217;t know whether Bobbie and
Charlie caught the milk train back to town or
not; but they got away sometime before breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; says Sadie, chokin&#8217; off a yawn
as she pours the coffee, &#8220;this was their first
evening together, you know. I suppose they
had a lot to say to each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must have had,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t
think they&#8217;d have to repeat that performance
for a month.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>Next night, though, it&#8217;s the same thing, and
the next, and the next. &#8220;Poor things!&#8221; thinks
I. &#8220;I expect they&#8217;re afraid of being guyed.&#8221;
So, just to show how sociable and friendly I
could be, I tries buttin&#8217; in on these lonely teeter-tates.
First I&#8217;d hunt up one couple and submit
some samples of my best chatter&mdash;gettin&#8217;
about as much reply as if I was ringin&#8217; Central
with the wire down. Then I locates the other
pair, drags a rocker over near &#8217;em, and tries
to make the dialogue three handed. They
stands it for a minute or so before decidin&#8217; to
move to another spot.</p>
<p>Honest, I never expected to feel lonesome
right at home entertainin&#8217; guests! but I was
gettin&#8217; acquainted with the sensation. There&#8217;s
no musical doings, no happy groups and gay
laughter about the house; nothing but now
and then a whisper from dark corners, or the
creak of the porch swings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! but they&#8217;re takin&#8217; their spoonin&#8217;
serious, ain&#8217;t they?&#8221; says I to Sadie. &#8220;And
how popular we are with &#8217;em! Makes me feel
almost like I ought to put on a gag and sit
down cellar in the coalbin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; says Sadie, makin&#8217; a bluff she
didn&#8217;t mind. &#8220;Do let them enjoy themselves
in their own way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I will,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Only this chaperon
business is gettin&#8217; on my nerves. I don&#8217;t feel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
like a host here; I feel more like a second story
man dodgin&#8217; the night watchman.&#8221;</p>
<p>There wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any signs of a change, either.
When they had to be around where we was
they had hardly a word to say and acted bored
to death; and it must have taxed their brains,
workin&#8217; up all them cute little schemes for
leavin&#8217; us on a siding so they could pair off.
Course, I&#8217;ve seen engaged couples before; but
I never met any that had the disease quite so
hard. And this bein&#8217; shunned like I had somethin&#8217;
catchin&#8217; was new to me. I begun to feel
like I was about ninety years old and in the
way.</p>
<p>Sunday forenoon was the limit, though.
Sadie had planned to take &#8217;em all for a motor
trip; but they declines with thanks. Would
they rather go out on the water? No, they
didn&#8217;t care for that, either. All they seems
to want to do is wander round, two by two,
where we ain&#8217;t. And at that Sadie loses some
of her enthusiasm for havin&#8217; bunches of lovers
around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; I hears her remark as she
watches Bobbie and Marjorie sidestep her and
go meanderin&#8217; off down a path to the rocks.</p>
<p>A little while later I happens to stroll down
to the summerhouse with the Sunday paper,
and as I steps in one door Charlie and Helen
slip out by the other. They&#8217;d seen me first.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; says I. &#8220;I never knew before
how unentertainin&#8217; I could be.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I was just wonderin&#8217; how I could relieve
my feelin&#8217;s without eatin&#8217; a fuzzy worm,
like the small boy that nobody loved, when I
hears footsteps approachin&#8217; through the shrubb&#8217;ry.
I looks up, to find myself bein&#8217; inspected
by a weedy, long legged youth. He&#8217;s an odd
lookin&#8217; kid, with dull reddish hair, so many
freckles that his face looks rusty, and a pair
of big purple black eyes that gazes at me
serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, son,&#8221; says I, &#8220;where did you drop
from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Harold Burbank Fitzmorris,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;and I am visiting with my mother
on the adjoining estate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds like a full description, Harold,&#8221;
says I. &#8220;Did you stray off, or was you
sent?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust you don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; says he; &#8220;but
I am exploring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Explore away then,&#8221; says I, &#8220;so long as
you don&#8217;t tramp through the flowerbeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t think of injuring them,&#8221;
says he. &#8220;I am passionately fond of flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say!&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; says Harold, droppin&#8217; down easy
on the bench alongside of me. &#8220;I love Nature
in all her moods. I am a poet, you know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Eh!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t you beginning sort
of young?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly all the really great men of literature,&#8221;
comes back Harold as prompt as if he
was speakin&#8217; a piece, &#8220;have begun their careers
by writing verse. I presume mine might be
considered somewhat immature; but I am impelled
from within to do it. All that will pass,
however, when I enter on my serious work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then you&#8217;ve got a job on the hook,
have you!&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect,&#8221; says Harold, smilin&#8217; sort of
indulgent and runnin&#8217; his fingers careless
through his thick coppery hair, &#8220;to produce my
first novel when I am twenty. It will have a
somber theme, something after the manner of
Turgenieff. Do you not find Turgenieff very
stimulating?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harold,&#8221; says I, &#8220;all them Hungarian
wines are more or less heady, and a kid like
you shouldn&#8217;t monkey with any of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looks almost pained at that. &#8220;You&#8217;re
chaffing me now, I suppose,&#8221; says he. &#8220;That
sort of thing, though, I never indulge in. Humor,
you know, is but froth on the deep seas
of thought. It has never seemed to me quite
worth one&#8217;s while. You will pardon my frankness,
I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harold,&#8221; says I, &#8220;you&#8217;re a wizard. So
it&#8217;s nix on the josh, eh?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What singular metaphors you employ!&#8221;
says he. &#8220;Do you know, I can hardly follow
you. However, colloquial language does not
offend my ear. It is only when I see it in
print that I shudder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me too,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I&#8217;m just as sore on
these foreign languages as anyone. So you&#8217;re
visitin&#8217; next door, eh? Enjoyin&#8217; yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>That was a plain cue for Harold Burbank
to launch out on the story of his life; but, say,
he didn&#8217;t need any such encouragement. He
was a willin&#8217; and ready converser, Harold was;
and&mdash;my!&mdash;what a lot of classy words he did
have on tap! First off I wondered how it
was a youngster like him could dig up so many;
but when I&#8217;d heard a little more about him
I could account for it all.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d cut his teeth, as you might say, on the
encyclopedia. Harold&#8217;s father had been a professor
of dead languages, and I guess he must
have died of it. Anyway, Mother was a widow,
and from things Harold dropped I judged she
was more or less frisky, spendin&#8217; her time at
bridge and chasin&#8217; teas and dinner parties. It
was clear she wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any highbrow, such as
Father must have been. All of which was disappointin&#8217;
to Harold. He made no bones of
sayin&#8217; so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why pretend to approve of one&#8217;s parent,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;when approval is undeserved?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>There was a lot of other folks that Harold
disapproved of too. In fact, he was a mighty
critical youth, only bein&#8217; able to entertain a
good opinion of but one certain party. At any
other time I expect he&#8217;d have given me an
earache; but I&#8217;d been handed so much silence
by our double Romeo-Juliet bunch that most
any kind of conversation was welcome just
then. So I lets him spiel away.</p>
<p>And, say, he acts like he was hungry for the
chance. Why, he gives me his ideas on every
subject you could think of, from the way Napoleon
got himself started on the toboggan,
to the folly of eatin&#8217; fried ham for breakfast.
He sure was a wonder, that kid! Two solid
hours we chinned there in the summerhouse,
and it was almost by main strength I broke
away for a one o&#8217;clock dinner.</p>
<p>Then, just as I&#8217;d got settled comf&#8217;table on
the veranda in the afternoon, he shows up and
begins again. There was nothin&#8217; diffident or
backward about Harold. He didn&#8217;t have any
doubts about whether he was welcome or not,
and his confidence about bein&#8217; able to entertain
was amazin&#8217;.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t do any good to throw out hints that
perhaps he was bein&#8217; missed at home, or to
yawn and pretend you was sleepy. He was
as persistent as a mosquito singin&#8217; its evenin&#8217;
song, and most as irritatin&#8217;. Twice I gets up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
and pikes off, tryin&#8217; to shake him; but Harold
trails right along too. Maybe I&#8217;d yearned for
conversation. Well, I was gettin&#8217; it.</p>
<p>At last I grows desp&#8217;rate, and in about two
minutes more he would have been led home to
Mother with the request that she tether him
on her side of the fence, when I sees two of
the lovers strollin&#8217; off to find a nook that wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
preempted by the other pair. And all of a
sudden I has this rosy thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harold,&#8221; says I, &#8220;it&#8217;s most too bad, your
wastin&#8217; all this flossy talk on me, who can&#8217;t
appreciate its fine points as I should, when
there go some young people who might be
tickled to death to have you join &#8217;em. Suppose
you try cheerin&#8217; &#8217;em up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; says Harold, &#8220;I had not observed
them before. Thank you for the suggestion.
I will join them at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does he? Say, for the next couple of hours
I had the time of my life watchin&#8217; the
maneuvers. First off I expect they must have
thought him kind of cute, same as I did; but
it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t long before they begun tryin&#8217; to lose
him. If they shifted positions once, they did
a dozen times, from the summerhouse to the
rocks, then up to the veranda and back again,
with Harold Burbank taggin&#8217; right along and
spoutin&#8217; his best. He tackles first one pair, and
then the other, until fin&#8217;lly they all retreats
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
into the house. Harold hesitates a little about
walkin&#8217; through the door after &#8217;em, until I
waves my hand cordial.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make yourself right to home, Harold,&#8221;
says I. &#8220;Keep &#8217;em cheered up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not until he drives the girls off to their rooms
and has Bobbie and Charles glarin&#8217; murderous
at him, does he quit the sport and retire for
supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come over again this evenin&#8217;,&#8221; says I.
&#8220;You&#8217;re makin&#8217; a hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harold thanks me some more and says he
will. He&#8217;s a great one to keep his word too.
Bobbie and Marjorie have hardly snuggled
up in one end of a hammock to watch the
moon do things to the wavelets before here is
Harold, with a fresh line of talk that he&#8217;s bent
on deliverin&#8217; while the mood is on.</p>
<p>Gettin&#8217; no answer from his audience didn&#8217;t
bother him a bit; for passin&#8217; out the monologue
is his strong suit. Not to seem partial, he
trails down Charlie and Helen and converses
with them too. Course, all this occurrin&#8217; outside,
I couldn&#8217;t watch everything that took
place; but I sits in the lib&#8217;ry with Sadie a
lot more contented than I&#8217;d been before that
week.</p>
<p>And when Marjorie drifts in alone, along
about nine o&#8217;clock, and goes to drummin&#8217; on
the piano, I smiles. Ten minutes later Helen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
appears too; and it&#8217;s only when neither of the
boys show up that I begins wonderin&#8217;. I asks
no questions; but goes out on a scoutin&#8217; trip.
There&#8217;s nobody on the veranda at all. Down
by the waterfront, though, I could hear voices,
and I goes sleuthin&#8217; in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I could hear Harold sayin&#8217; as I got
most to the boat landin&#8217;, &#8220;the phosphorescence
that ignorant sailors attribute to electricity in
the air is really a minute marine animal
which&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I expect I&#8217;ll never know the rest; for just
then there&#8217;s a break in the lecture.</p>
<p>&#8220;One, two, three&mdash;now!&#8221; comes from Bobbie,
and before Harold can let out a single
squeal they&#8217;ve grabbed him firm and secure,
one by the heels and the other by the collar,
and they&#8217;ve begun sousin&#8217; him up and down
off the edge of the float. It was high tide too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uggle-guggle! Wow!&#8221; remarks Harold
between splashes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; observes Charles through,
his teeth. &#8220;Swallow a lot of it, you windbag!
It&#8217;ll do you good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Course, these young gents was guests of mine,
and I hadn&#8217;t interfered before with their partic&#8217;lar
way of enjoyin&#8217; themselves; so I couldn&#8217;t
begin now. But after they was through, and
a draggled, chokin&#8217;, splutterin&#8217; youth had gone
beatin&#8217; it up the path and over towards the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
next place, I strolls down to meet &#8217;em as they
are comin&#8217; up to the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope you didn&#8217;t see what happened down
there just now, Professor,&#8221; says Bobbie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Well, if I did I can forget
it quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, old man!&#8221; says both of &#8217;em, pattin&#8217;
me friendly on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;The little beast!&#8221; adds Charles. &#8220;He
had the nerve to say you had put him up to it.
That&#8217;s what finally earned him his ducking,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Such a nice spoken
youngster too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; says Bobbie. &#8220;I suppose there&#8217;ll
be no end of a row about this when he gets
home with his tale; but we&#8217;ll stand for it.
Meanwhile let&#8217;s go up and get the girls to give
us some music.&#8221;</p>
<p>Say, I don&#8217;t believe Harold ever mentioned
it to a soul. It&#8217;s a funny thing too, but he
hasn&#8217;t been over here since. And someway,
gettin&#8217; better acquainted with the boys in that
fashion, made it pleasanter all round.</p>
<p>But no more entertainin&#8217; lovers for us!
Harolds ain&#8217;t common enough.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>CORNELIA SHOWS SOME CLASS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, by the way, Shorty,&#8221; says Sadie to me
the other mornin&#8217;, just as I&#8217;m makin&#8217; an early
get-away for town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another postscript, eh?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Well,
let it come over speedy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something for Mrs. Purdy-Pell,&#8221; says
she. &#8220;I&#8217;d almost forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it orderin&#8217; some fancy groceries, or
sendin&#8217; out a new laundry artist?&#8221; says I.
&#8220;If it is, why I guess I can&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; says Sadie, givin&#8217; my tie an extra
pat and brushin&#8217; some imaginary dust off my
coat collar; &#8220;it&#8217;s about Cousin Cornelia. She&#8217;s
in town, you know, and neither of the Purdy-Pells
can get in to see her before next week
on account of their garden party, and Cornelia
is staying at a hotel alone, and they&#8217;re a little
anxious about her. So look her up, won&#8217;t you?
I told them you would. You don&#8217;t mind, do
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve been waitin&#8217;
for this. Makin&#8217; afternoon calls on weepy old
maids is my specialty.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There, there!&#8221; says Sadie, followin&#8217; me
out on the veranda. &#8220;Don&#8217;t play the martyr!
Perhaps Cornelia isn&#8217;t the most entertaining
person in the world, for she certainly has had
her share of trouble; but it isn&#8217;t going to hurt
you merely to find out how she is situated and
ask if you can be of any help to her. You
know, if there was anything she could do for
us, she would&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure!&#8221; says I. &#8220;If I&#8217;m ever brought
home on a shutter, I shall look for Cornelia
to be waitin&#8217; on the mat with a needle and
thread, ready to sew mournin&#8217; bands on the
help.&#8221;</p>
<p>That seems to be Cousin Cornelia&#8217;s steady
job in life, tendin&#8217; out on the sick and being
in at the obsequies. Anyway, she&#8217;s been at it
ever since we knew her. She&#8217;s a cousin of
Mr. Purdy-Pell&#8217;s, and his branch of the fam&#8217;ly,
being composed mainly of antiques and chronic
invalids, has been shufflin&#8217; off in one way or
another for the last three or four years at
the rate of about one every six months.</p>
<p>Course, it was kind of sad to see a fam&#8217;ly
peter out that way; but, as a matter of fact,
most of &#8217;em was better off. At first the Purdy-Pells
started in to chop all their social dates
for three months after each sorrowful event;
but when they saw they was being let in for
a continuous performance, they sort of detailed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
Cousin Cornelia to do their heavy mournin&#8217; and
had a black edge put on their stationery.</p>
<p>Maybe Cornelia didn&#8217;t exactly yearn for the
portfolio; but she didn&#8217;t have much choice about
taking it. She was kind of a hanger-on, Cornelia
was, you see, and she was used to going
where she was sent. So when word would come
that Aunt Mehitabel&#8217;s rheumatism was worse
and was threatenin&#8217; her heart, that meant a
hurry call for Cousin Cornelia. She&#8217;d pack a
couple of suit cases full of black skirts and
white shirtwaists, and off she&#8217;d go, not showin&#8217;
up again at the Purdy-Pells&#8217; town house until
Aunty had been safely planted and the headstone
ordered.</p>
<p>You couldn&#8217;t say but what she did it thorough,
too; for she&#8217;d come back wearin&#8217; a long
crape veil and lookin&#8217; pasty faced and wore
out. Don&#8217;t know as I ever saw her when she
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t either just comin&#8217; from where there&#8217;d
been a funeral, or just startin&#8217; for where there
was likely to be one.</p>
<p>So she didn&#8217;t cut much of a figure in all
the gay doin&#8217;s the Purdy-Pells was always
mixed up in. And yet she wasn&#8217;t such a kiln
dried prune as you might expect, after all.
Rather a well built party, Cornelia was, with
a face that would pass in a crowd, and a sort of
longin&#8217; twist to her mouth corners as if she
wanted to crack a smile now and then, providin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
the chance would only come her way.</p>
<p>And it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t hardly a square deal to list
her with the U.B.&#8217;s as soon as we did; for
all this time she was doing the chief mourner
act she was engaged to young Durgin. First
off it was understood that she was waitin&#8217; for
him to settle on whether he was goin&#8217; to be a
minister or a doctor, him fiddlin&#8217; round at college,
now takin&#8217; one course and then another;
but at last he makes up his mind to chuck both
propositions and take a hack at the law.</p>
<p>Durgin got there, too, which was more or
less of a surprise to all hands, and actually
broke in as partner in a good firm. Then it
was a case of Durgin waitin&#8217; for Cornelia; for
about that time the relations got to droppin&#8217;
off in one-two-three order, and she seemed to
think that so long as she&#8217;d started in on the
job of ridin&#8217; in the first carriage, she ought to
see it through.</p>
<p>Whether it was foolish of her or not, ain&#8217;t
worth while debatin&#8217; now. Anyhow, she stuck
to it until the last one had cashed in, puttin&#8217;
Durgin off from month to month and year to
year. Then it turns out that the last of the
bunch, Uncle Theodore, had left her a good-sized
wad that Purdy-Pell had always supposed
was comin&#8217; to him, but which he didn&#8217;t
grudge to Cornelia a bit.</p>
<p>So there she was, all the lingerin&#8217; ones off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
her hands, and her sportin&#8217; a bank account of
her own. She&#8217;s some tired out, though; so,
after sendin&#8217; Durgin word that they might as
well wait until fall now, she hikes off to some
little place in New Hampshire and spends the
summer restin&#8217; up. Next she comes down unexpected
and hits New York.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, Durgin has suddenly
decided to scratch his entry for that
partic&#8217;lar Matrimonial Handicap. Not that he&#8217;s
seriously int&#8217;rested in somebody else, but he&#8217;s
kind of got weary hangin&#8217; around, and he&#8217;s
seen a few livelier ones than Cornelia, and he
feels that somehow him and her have made a
great mistake. You know how they&#8217;re apt to
talk when they get chilly below the ankles? He
don&#8217;t hand this straight out to Cornelia, mind
you, but goes to Mrs. Purdy-Pell and Sadie
with the tale, wantin&#8217; to know what he&#8217;d better
do.</p>
<p>Now I ain&#8217;t got any grouch against Durgin.
He&#8217;s all right, I expect, in his way, more or
less of a stiff necked, mealy mouthed chump,
I always thought; but they say he&#8217;s nice to
his old mother, and he&#8217;s makin&#8217; good in the
law business, and he ain&#8217;t bad to look at. The
women folks takes his side right off. They say
they don&#8217;t blame him a bit, and, without
stoppin&#8217; to think how Cousin Cornelia is going
to feel left alone there on the siding, they get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
busy pickin&#8217; out new candidates for Durgin
to choose from.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s the situation when I&#8217;m handed
this assignment to go and inspect the head of
the Purdy-Pells&#8217; obituary department and see
if she&#8217;s all comfy. Couldn&#8217;t have weighed very
heavy on my mind; for I don&#8217;t think of it until
late afternoon, just as I&#8217;m startin&#8217; to pull out
for home. Then I says to myself that maybe
it&#8217;ll do just as well if I ring her up on the
&#8217;phone at her hotel. She&#8217;s in, all right, and I
explains over the wire how anxious I am to
know if she&#8217;s all right, and hopes nobody has
tried to kidnap her yet, and asks if there&#8217;s anything
I can do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, how kind of you, Mr. McCabe!&#8221; says
Cornelia. &#8220;Yes, I am perfectly well and quite
safe here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; says I. And then, seein&#8217; how easy
I was gettin&#8217; out of it, I has to pile on the
agony a little by addin&#8217;, &#8220;Ain&#8217;t there some way
I can be useful, though? No errands you want
done, or any place you&#8217;d like to be towed around
to, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; says she, hesitatin&#8217;.
&#8220;Oh, but I couldn&#8217;t think of troubling you, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; says I, gettin&#8217; reckless. &#8220;Just
remember that I&#8217;d be tickled to death, any time
you push the button.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We-e-ell,&#8221; says she, &#8220;we were just wishing,
Miss Stover and I, that we did have some
gentleman friend who would&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Count me in,&#8221; says I. &#8220;What&#8217;s the
game? Trip to Woodlawn Cemetery some day,
or do you want to be piloted up to Grant&#8217;s
Tomb?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t either of them festive splurges
she had in mind. They wanted a dinner escort
for that evenin&#8217;, she and Miss Stover. The
other lady, she goes on to say, is a school teacher
from up Boston way, that she&#8217;d made friends
with durin&#8217; the summer. Miss Stover was
takin&#8217; a year off, for the benefit of her nerves,
and before she sailed on her Cook&#8217;s trip abroad
she thought she&#8217;d like to see a little of New
York. They&#8217;d been tryin&#8217; to knock around
some alone, and had got along all right daytimes,
but hadn&#8217;t dared venture out much at
night. So if I wanted to be real generous, and
it wouldn&#8217;t be too much of a bore, they&#8217;d be
very thankful if I would&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a minute,&#8221; says I and, seein&#8217; I was up
against it anyhow, I thought I might as well
do it cheerful. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be up about six, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chee!&#8221; says Swifty Joe, who always has
his ear stretched out on such occasions, &#8220;you
make a noise like you was fixin&#8217; up a date.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What good hearin&#8217; you have, Swifty!&#8221;
says I. &#8220;Some day, though, you&#8217;ll strain one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
of them side flaps of yours. Yes, this is a date,
and it&#8217;s with two of the sportiest female parties
that ever dodged an old ladies&#8217; home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Excitin&#8217; proposition, wa&#8217;n&#8217;t it? I spends the
next half-hour battin&#8217; my head to think of some
first class food parlor where I could cart a
couple like this Boston schoolma&#8217;am and Cousin
Cornelia without shockin&#8217; &#8217;em. There was the
Martha Washington; but I knew I&#8217;d be barred
there. Also there was some quiet fam&#8217;ly hotels
I&#8217;d heard of up town; but I couldn&#8217;t remember
exactly what street any of &#8217;em was on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Cornelia will have some plans of
her own,&#8221; thinks I, as I gets into my silk faced
dinner jacket and V-cut vest. &#8220;And I hope
she ain&#8217;t wearin&#8217; more&#8217;n two thicknesses of
crape veil now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, soon after six I slides out, hops on one
of these shed-as-you-enter surface cars, and
rides up to the hotel. I&#8217;d been holdin&#8217; down
one of the velvet chairs in the ladies&#8217; parlor
for near half an hour, and was wonderin&#8217; if
Cornelia had run out of black headed pins, or
what, when I pipes off a giddy specimen in
wistaria costume that drifts in and begins
squintin&#8217; around like she was huntin&#8217; for some
one. Next thing I knew she&#8217;d spotted me and
was sailin&#8217; right over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there you are!&#8221; she gurgles, holdin&#8217;
out her hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, lady,&#8221; says I, sidesteppin&#8217; behind
the chair, &#8220;but ain&#8217;t you tryin&#8217; to tag
the wrong party?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; says she, lettin&#8217; out a chuckle,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you know me, Mr. McCabe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but it looks like I
would if&mdash;&mdash;Great snakes!&#8221;</p>
<p>And honest, you could hardly have covered
my face cavity with a waffle iron when I drops
to the fact that it&#8217;s Cousin Cornelia. In place
of the dismal female I&#8217;d been expectin&#8217;, here&#8217;s
a chirky party in vivid regalia that shows class
in every line. Oh, it&#8217;s a happy days uniform,
all right, from the wide brimmed gauze lid
with the long heliotrope feather trailin&#8217; over
one side, to the lavender kid pumps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; I gasps. &#8220;The round is on me,
Miss Cornelia. But I wa&#8217;n&#8217;t lookin&#8217; for you
in&mdash;in&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; says she. &#8220;This is the first time
I&#8217;ve worn colors for years, and I feel so odd.
I hope I don&#8217;t look too&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look all to the skookum,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>It wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any jolly, either. There never was
any real sharp angles to Cornelia, and now I
come to reckon up I couldn&#8217;t place her as
more&#8217;n twenty-six or twenty-seven at the outside.
So why shouldn&#8217;t she show up fairly
well in a Gibson model?</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so good of you to come to our rescue,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
says she. &#8220;Miss Stover will be down presently.
Now, where shall we go to dinner?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I see in a minute I&#8217;ve got to revise
my plans; so I begins namin&#8217; over some of the
swell grillrooms and cafes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we have been to most of those, all by
ourselves,&#8221; says Cornelia. &#8220;What we would
like to see to-night is some real&mdash;well, a place
where we couldn&#8217;t go alone, out somewhere&mdash;an
automobile resort, for instance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whe-e-ew!&#8221; says I through my front
teeth. &#8220;Say, Miss Cornie, but you are gettin&#8217;
out of the bereft class for fair! I guess it&#8217;s
comin&#8217; to you, though. Now jest let me get
an idea of how far you want to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; says she, shruggin&#8217; her shoulders,&mdash;&#8220;how
is it you put such things?&mdash;the limit, I
suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Then how about
Clover Blossom Inn?&#8221;</p>
<p>Heard about that joint, haven&#8217;t you? Of
course. There&#8217;s a lot of joy-ride tank stations
strung along Jerome-ave. and the Yonkers
road; but when it comes to a genuine tabasco
flavored chorus girls&#8217; rest, the Clover Blossom
has most of the others lookin&#8217; like playgrounds
for little mothers. But Cornie don&#8217;t do any
dodgin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; says she. &#8220;I&#8217;ve read about that
inn.&#8221; Then she hurries on to plan out the details.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
I must go over to Times Square and
hire a nice looking touring car for the evening.
And I mustn&#8217;t let Miss Stover know how much
it costs; for Cornelia wants to do that part of
it by her lonely.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dinner we are to go shares on,&#8221; says
she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t think of it,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Let that
stand as my blow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; says Cornelia. &#8220;We have
the money all put aside, and I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t like it.
Here it is, and I want you to be sure you spend
the whole of it,&#8221; and with that she shoves over
a couple of fives.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help grinnin&#8217; as I takes it. Maybe
you&#8217;ve settled a dinner bill for three and a
feed for the shofer at the Clover Blossom;
but not with a ten-spot, eh?</p>
<p>And while Cornelia is goin&#8217; back in the elevator
after the schoolma&#8217;am, I scoots over to
get a machine. After convincin&#8217; two or three
of them leather capped pirates that I didn&#8217;t
want to buy their blamed outfits, I fin&#8217;lly beats
one down to twenty-five and goes back after
the ladies.</p>

&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Cornelia whispered about the peroxide puffed girl</span>&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Miss Stover don&#8217;t turn out to be any such
star as Cornelia; but she don&#8217;t look so much like
a suffragette as I expected. She&#8217;s plump, and
middle aged, and plain dressed; but there&#8217;s
more or less style to the way she carries herself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
Also she has just a suspicion of eye
twinkle behind the glasses, which suggests that
perhaps some of this programme is due to
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;All aboard for the Clover Blossom!&#8221; says
I, handin&#8217; &#8217;em into the tonneau; &#8220;that is, as
soon as I run in here to the telephone booth.&#8221;</p>
<p>It had come to me only at that minute what
a shame it was this stunt of Cornelia&#8217;s was
goin&#8217; to be wasted on an audience that couldn&#8217;t
appreciate the fine points, and I&#8217;d thought of a
scheme that might supply the gap. So I calls
up an old friend of mine and has a little confab.</p>
<p>By the time we&#8217;d crossed the Harlem and
had got straightened out on the parkway with
our gas lamps lighted, and the moon comin&#8217;
up over the trees, and hundreds of other cars
whizzin&#8217; along in both directions, Cornelia and
her schoolma&#8217;am friend was chatterin&#8217; away
like a couple of boardin&#8217; school girls. There&#8217;s
no denyin&#8217; that it does get into your blood, that
sort of ridin&#8217;. Why, even I begun to feel some
frisky!</p>
<p>And look at Cornelia! For years she&#8217;d been
givin&#8217; directions about where to put the floral
wreaths, and listenin&#8217; to wills being read, and
all summer long she&#8217;d been buried in a little
backwoods boardin&#8217; house, where the most excitin&#8217;
event of the day was watchin&#8217; the cows
come home, or going down for the mail. Can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
you blame her for workin&#8217; up a cheek flush and
rattlin&#8217; off nonsense?</p>
<p>Clover Blossom Inn does look fine and fancy
at night, too, with all the colored lights strung
around, and the verandas crowded with tables,
and the Gypsy orchestra sawin&#8217; away, and new
parties landin&#8217; from the limousines every few
minutes. Course, I knew they&#8217;d run against
perfect ladies hittin&#8217; up cocktails and cigarettes
in the cloak room, and hear more or less high
spiced remarks; but this was what they&#8217;d
picked out to view.</p>
<p>So I orders the brand of dinner the waiter
hints I ought to have,&mdash;little necks, okra soup,
broiled lobster, guinea hen, and so on, with a
large bottle of fizz decoratin&#8217; the silver tub on
the side and some sporty lookin&#8217; mineral for
me. It don&#8217;t make any diff&#8217;rence whether
you&#8217;ve got a wealthy water thirst or not, when
you go to one of them tootsy palaces you might
just as well name your vintage first as last;
for any cheap skates of suds consumers is apt
to find that the waiter&#8217;s made a mistake and
their table has been reserved for someone else.</p>
<p>But if you don&#8217;t mind payin&#8217; four prices, and
can stand the comp&#8217;ny at the adjoinin&#8217; tables,
just being part of the picture and seeing it
from the inside is almost worth the admission.
If there&#8217;s any livelier purple spots on the map
than these gasolene road houses from eight-thirty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>p. m.</span> to two-thirty in the mornin&#8217;, I&#8217;ll let
you name &#8217;em.</p>
<p>Cornelia rather shies at the sight of the fat
bottle peekin&#8217; out of the cracked ice; but she
gets over that feelin&#8217; after Miss Stover has
expressed her sentiments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Champagne!&#8221; says the schoolma&#8217;am.
&#8220;Oh, how perfectly delightful! Do you know,
I always have wanted to know how it tasted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Say, she knows all about it now. Not that
she put away any more&#8217;n a lady should,&mdash;at
the Clover Blossom,&mdash;but she had tackled a dry
Martini first, and then she kept on tastin&#8217; and
tastin&#8217; her glass of fizz, and the waiter keeps
fillin&#8217; it up, and that twinkle in her eye develops
more and more, and her conversation
gets livelier and livelier. So does Cornelia&#8217;s.
They gets off some real bright things, too.
You&#8217;d never guess there was so much fun in
Cornie, or that she could look so much like a
stunner.</p>
<p>She was just leanin&#8217; over to whisper something
to me about the peroxide puffed girl at
the next table, and I was tryin&#8217; to stand bein&#8217;
tickled in the neck by that long feather of hers
while I listens, and Miss Stover was snuggled
up real chummy on the other side, when I looks
up the aisle and sees a little group watchin&#8217;
us with their mouths open and their eyebrows
up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>Leadin&#8217; the way is Pinckney. Oh, he&#8217;d done
his part, all right, just as I&#8217;d told him over the
wire; for right behind him is Durgin, starin&#8217;
at Cornelia until he was pop eyed.</p>
<p>But that wa&#8217;n&#8217;t all. Trust Pinckney to add
something. Beyond Durgin is Mrs. Purdy-Pell&mdash;and
Sadie. Now, I&#8217;ve seen Mrs. McCabe
when she&#8217;s been some jarred; but I don&#8217;t
know as I ever watched the effect of such a jolt
as this. You see, Cornelia&#8217;s back was to her,
and all Sadie can see is that wistaria lid with
the feather danglin&#8217; down my neck.</p>
<p>Sadie don&#8217;t indulge in any preliminaries.
She marches right along, with her chin in the
air, and glues them Irish blue eyes of hers on
me in a way I can feel yet. &#8220;Well, I must
say!&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I, tryin&#8217; hard to put on a pleased
grin. &#8220;So Pinckney brought you along too,
did he? Lovely evenin&#8217;, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Sadie?&#8221; says Cornelia, jumpin&#8217; up
and givin&#8217; &#8217;em a full face view. And you
should have seen how that knocks the wind out
of Sadie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha-a-at!&#8221; says she. &#8220;You?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; says Cornie. &#8220;And we&#8217;re
just having the grandest lark, and&mdash;&mdash;Oh!
Why, Durgin! Where in the world did you
come from? How jolly!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; says I. &#8220;You see, Sadie, I&#8217;m
carryin&#8217; out instructions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, the minute she gets wise that it&#8217;s all a
job that Pinckney and I have put up between
us, and discovers that my giddy lookin&#8217; friend
is only Cousin Cornelia doin&#8217; the butterfly act,
the thunder storm is all over. The waiter
shoves up another table, and they plants Durgin
next to Cornie, and the festivities takes a
new start.</p>
<p>Did Durgin boy forget all about them chilly
feet of his? Why, you could almost see the
frost startin&#8217; out before he&#8217;d said a dozen
words, and by the time he&#8217;d let the whole effect
sink in, he was no nearer contractin&#8217; chilblains
than a Zulu with his heels in the campfire.</p>
<p>What pleases me most, though, was the scientific
duck I made in the last round. We&#8217;d
gone clear through the menu, and they was
finishin&#8217; up their cordials, when I spots the
waiter comin&#8217; with a slip of paper on his tray
as long as a pianola roll.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Pinckney,&#8221; says I, &#8220;see what&#8217;s
comin&#8217; now!&#8221;</p>
<p>And when Pinckney reached around and discovers
what it is, he digs down for his roll
like a true sport, never battin&#8217; an eyelash.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would ring in the fam&#8217;ly on me, would
you,&#8221; says I, &#8220;when I&#8217;m showin&#8217; lady friends
the sights?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>DOPING OUT AN ODD ONE</h3>
</div>

<p>Say, notice any deep sea roll about my walk?
No? Well, maybe you can get the tarry perfume
as I pass by? Funny you don&#8217;t; for I&#8217;ve
been a Vice Commodore for most three weeks
now. Yes, that&#8217;s on the level&mdash;belay my spinnaker
taffrail if it ain&#8217;t!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I get for bein&#8217; one of the charter
members of the Rockhurst Yacht Club. You
didn&#8217;t, eh? Well, say, I&#8217;m one of the yachtiest
yachters that ever jibbed a gangway. Not that
I do any sailin&#8217; exactly; but I guess Sadie and
me each paid good money for our shares of
club stock, and if that ain&#8217;t as foolish an act
as you can find in the nautical calendar, then
I&#8217;ll eat the binnacle boom.</p>
<p>Course, this Vice Commodore stunt was sort
of sprung on me; for I&#8217;d been such an active
member I didn&#8217;t even know the bloomin&#8217; clubhouse
was finished until here the other day
I gets this bulletin from the annual meetin&#8217;,
along with the programme for the openin&#8217; exercises.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Vice Commodore! Say,
there must be some mistake about this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; says Sadie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure there is,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Why, I hardly
know one end of a boat from the other; and
besides I ain&#8217;t got any clubby habits. They&#8217;ve
been let in wrong, that&#8217;s all. I&#8217;ll resign.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do nothing of the sort!&#8221; says Sadie.
&#8220;When I took all that trouble to have you win
over that ridiculous Bronson-Smith!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Been playin&#8217; the Mrs.
Taft, have you? In that case, I expect I&#8217;ll
have to stay with it. But, honest, you can
look for a season of perfectly punk Vice Commodorin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>As it turns out, though, there ain&#8217;t one in
ten members that knows much more about
yachtin&#8217; than I do. Navigatin&#8217; porch rockers,
orderin&#8217; all hands up for fancy drinks, and
conductin&#8217; bridge whist regattas was their chief
sea-goin&#8217; accomplishments; and when it come
to makin&#8217; myself useful, who was it, I&#8217;d like
to know, that chucked the boozy steward off
the float when he had two of the house committee
treed up the signal mast?</p>
<p>I suspect that&#8217;s how it is I&#8217;m played up so
prominent for this house warmin&#8217; episode.
Anyway, when I arrives there on the great
night&mdash;me all got up fancy in a double breasted
serge coat, white flannel pants, and cork soled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
canvas shoes&mdash;I finds they&#8217;ve put me on the
reception committee; and that, besides welcomin&#8217;
invited guests, I&#8217;m expected to keep one
eye peeled for outsiders, to see that nobody
starts nothin&#8217;.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m on deck, as you might say, and more
or less conspicuous, when this Larchmont delegation
is landed and comes stringin&#8217; up. It
was &#8220;Ahoy there, Captain This!&#8221; and &#8220;How
are you, Captain That?&#8221; from the rest of the
committee, who was some acquainted; and me
buttin&#8217; around earnest tryin&#8217; to find someone
to shake hands with, when I runs across this
thick set party in the open front Tuxedo regalia,
with his opera hat down over one eye
and a long cigar raked up coquettish from the
sou&#8217;west corner of his face.</p>
<p>Know him? I guess! It&#8217;s Peter K. Tracey;
yes, the one that has his name on so many
four-sheet posters. Noticed how he always has
&#8217;em read, ain&#8217;t you? &#8220;Mr. Peter K. Tracey
presents Booth Keene, the sterling young
actor.&#8221; Never forgets that &#8220;Mr.&#8221;; but, say,
I knew him when he signed it just &#8220;P. Tracey,&#8221;
and chewed his tongue some at gettin&#8217; that
down.</p>
<p>Them was the days when he&#8217;d have jumped
at the chance of managin&#8217; my ring exhibits,
and he was known in sportin&#8217; circles as Chunk
Tracey. I ain&#8217;t followed all his moves since
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
then; but I know he got to handlin&#8217; the big
heavyweights on exhibition tours, broke into
the theatrical game with an animal show that
was a winner, and has stuck to the boxoffice
end ever since.</p>
<p>Why shouldn&#8217;t he, with a half ownership in
a mascot Rube drama that never has less than
six road companies playin&#8217; it, and at least one
hit on Broadway every season? I admit I was
some surprised, though, to hear of him buyin&#8217;
a house on Fifth-ave. and makin&#8217; a stab at
mixin&#8217; in society. That last I could hardly
believe; but here he was, and lookin&#8217; as much
jarred at findin&#8217; me as I was to see him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be hanged!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Chunk
Tracey!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, hello, Shorty!&#8221; says he, and neither
one of us remembers the &#8220;Charmed to see yuh,
old chappy&#8221; lines we should have been shootin&#8217;
off. Seems he&#8217;d been towed along with a bunch
of near-swells that didn&#8217;t dare treat him as if
he really belonged, and he was almost frothin&#8217;
at the mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk about your society folks!&#8221; says he.
&#8220;Why,&mdash;blankety blank &#8217;em!&mdash;I can go down
the Rialto any afternoon, pick up a dozen people
at twenty-five a week, drill &#8217;em four days, and
give a better imitation than this crowd ever
thought of putting up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but look who you are, Chunk,&#8221; says I.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>And he meant it too. He always was about
the cockiest little rooster in the business; but
I&#8217;d rather expected eight or ten years of ups
and downs in the theatrical game, bein&#8217; thrown
out of the trust and crawlin&#8217; back on his knees
would have tempered him down some.</p>
<p>You couldn&#8217;t notice it, though. In fact, this
chesty, cocksure attitude seemed to have grown
on him, and it was plain that most of his soreness
just now come from findin&#8217; himself in with
a lot of folks that didn&#8217;t take any special pains
to admit what a great man he was. So, as
him and me was sort of left to flock by ourselves,
I undertook the job of supplyin&#8217; a few
soothin&#8217; remarks, just for old time&#8217;s sake. And
that&#8217;s how it was he got rung in on this little
mix-up with Cap&#8217;n Spiller.</p>
<p>You see, the way the committee had mapped
it out, part of the doin&#8217;s was a grand illumination
of the fleet. Anyway, they had all the
craft they could muster anchored in a semicircle
off the end of the float and trimmed up
with Japanese lanterns. Well, just about time
for lightin&#8217; up, into the middle of the fleet
comes driftin&#8217; a punk lookin&#8217; old sloop with
dirty, patched sails, some shirts and things
hangin&#8217; from the riggin&#8217;, and a length of stovepipe
stickin&#8217; through the cabin roof. When
the skipper has struck the exact center, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
throws over his mud hook and lets his sail
run.</p>
<p>Not bein&#8217; posted on the details, I didn&#8217;t know
but that was part of the show, until the chairman
of my committee comes rushin&#8217; up to me
all excited, and points it out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I say, McCabe!&#8221; says he. &#8220;Do you
see that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; says I, &#8220;I could almost smell
it from here. Some new member, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Member!&#8221; he gasps. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s some
dashed old fisherman! We&mdash;we cawn&#8217;t have
him stay there, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says I, &#8220;he seems to be gettin&#8217;
plenty of advice on that point.&#8221; And he was;
for they was shoutin&#8217; things at him through
a dozen megaphones.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you know, McCabe,&#8221; goes on the chairman,
&#8220;you ought to go out and send him
away. That&#8217;s one of your duties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I. &#8220;How long since I&#8217;ve been
official marine bouncer for this organization?
G&#8217;wan! Go tell him yourself!&#8221;</p>
<p>We had quite an argument over it too, with
Peter K. chimin&#8217; in on my side; but, while
the chappy insists that it&#8217;s my job to fire the
old hooker off the anchorage, I draws the line
at interferin&#8217; with anything beyond the shore.
Course, it might spoil the effect; but the way it
struck me was that we didn&#8217;t own any more of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
Long Island Sound than anyone else, and I
says so flat.</p>
<p>That must have been how the boss of the
old sloop felt about it too; for he don&#8217;t pay
any attention to the howls or threats. He just
makes things snug and then goes below and
starts pokin&#8217; about in his dinky little cabin.
Judgin&#8217; by the motions, he was gettin&#8217; a late
supper.</p>
<p>Anyway, they couldn&#8217;t budge him, even
though half the club was stewin&#8217; about it. And,
someway, that seemed to tickle Chunk and me
a lot. We watched him spread his grub out
on the cabin table, roll up his sleeves, and
square away like he had a good appetite, just
as if he&#8217;d been all by himself, instead of right
here in the midst of so many flossy yachtsmen.</p>
<p>He even had music to eat by; for part of the
programme was the turnin&#8217; loose of one of these
high priced cabinet disk machines, that was on
the Commodore&#8217;s big schooner, and feedin&#8217; it
with Caruso and Melba records. There was
so much chatterin&#8217; goin&#8217; on around us on the
verandas, and so many corks poppin&#8217; and
glasses clinkin&#8217;, that the skipper must have got
more benefit from the concert than anyone else.
At last he wipes his mouth on his sleeve careful,
fills his pipe, and crawls out on deck to
enjoy the view.</p>
<p>It was well worth lookin&#8217; at too; for, although
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
there was most too many clouds for
the moon to do much execution, here was all
the yachts lighted up, and the clubhouse blazin&#8217;
and gay, and the water lappin&#8217; gentle in between.
He gazes out at it placid for a minute
or so, and then we see him dive down into the
cabin. He comes back with something or other
that we couldn&#8217;t make out, and the next thing
I knows I finds myself keepin&#8217; time with my
foot to one of them lively, swingin&#8217; old tunes
which might have been &#8220;The Campbells Are
Coming&#8221; or might not; but anyway it was
enough to give you that tingly sensation in
your toes. And it was proceedin&#8217; from the
after deck of that old hulk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Bagpipes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bagpipes be blowed!&#8221; says Chunk.
&#8220;That&#8217;s an accordion he&#8217;s playing. Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>Say, I was listenin&#8217;, and with both ears.
Also other folks was beginnin&#8217; to do the same.
Inside of five minutes, too, all the chatter has
died down, and as I glanced around at the
tables I could see that whole crowd of fancy
dressed folks noddin&#8217; and beatin&#8217; time with
their fans and cigars and fizz glasses. Even
the waiters was standin&#8217; still, or tiptoin&#8217; so&#8217;s
to take it in.</p>
<p>Ever hear one of them out-of-date music
bellows handled by a natural born artist? Say,
I&#8217;ve always been partial to accordions myself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
though I never had the courage to own up to
it in public; but this was the first time I&#8217;d ever
heard one pumped in that classy fashion.</p>
<p>Music! Why, as he switches off onto &#8220;The
Old Folks at Home,&#8221; you&#8217;d thought there was
a church organ and a full orchestra out there!
Maybe comin&#8217; across the water had something
to do with it; but hanged if it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t great!
And of all the fine old tunes he gave us&mdash;&#8220;Nellie
Gray,&#8221; &#8220;Comin&#8217; Through the Rye,&#8221;
&#8220;Annie Laurie,&#8221; and half a dozen more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chunk,&#8221; says I, as the concert ends and
the folks begin to applaud, &#8220;there&#8217;s only one
thing to be done in a case like this. Lemme
take that lid of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; says he, and drops a fiver into
it before he passes it over. That wa&#8217;n&#8217;t the
only green money I collects, either, and by the
time I&#8217;ve made the entire round I must have
gathered up more&#8217;n a quart of spendin&#8217; currency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on there, Shorty,&#8221; says Chunk, as I
starts out to deliver the collection. &#8220;I&#8217;d like
to go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, then,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I guess
some of these sailormen will row us out.&#8221;</p>
<p>What we had framed up was one of these
husky, rugged, old hearts of oak, who would
choke up some on receivin&#8217; the tribute and give
us his blessin&#8217; in a sort of &#8220;Shore Acres&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
curtain speech. Part of that description he
lives up to. He&#8217;s some old, all right; but he
ain&#8217;t handsome or rugged. He&#8217;s a lean, dyspeptic
lookin&#8217; old party, with a wrinkled face
colored up like a pair of yellow shoes at the
end of a hard season. His hair is long and
matted, and he ain&#8217;t overly clean in any detail.
He don&#8217;t receive us real hearty, either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, keep your hands off that rail!&#8221; he
sings out, reachin&#8217; for a boathook as we come
alongside.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Cap,&#8221; says I. &#8220;We&#8217;re
friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Git out!&#8221; says he. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t got any
friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you have, old scout,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Anyway,
there&#8217;s a lot of people ashore that was
mighty pleased with the way you tickled that
accordion. Here&#8217;s proof of it too,&#8221; and I holds
up the hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; says he, gettin&#8217; his eye on the contents.
&#8220;Come aboard, then. Here, I guess
you can stow that stuff in there,&#8221; and blamed
if he don&#8217;t shove out an empty lard pail for
me to dump the money in. That&#8217;s as excited
as he gets about it too.</p>
<p>Say, I&#8217;d have indulged in about two more
minutes of dialogue with that ugly faced old
pirate, and then I&#8217;d beat it for shore good and
disgusted, if it hadn&#8217;t been for Chunk Tracey.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
But he jumps in, as enthusiastic as if he was
interviewin&#8217; some foreign Prince, presses a
twenty-five-cent perfecto on the Cap&#8217;n, and begins
pumpin&#8217; out of him the story of his
life.</p>
<p>And when Chunk really enthuses it&#8217;s got to
be a mighty cold proposition that don&#8217;t thaw
some. Ten to one, too, if this had been a nice,
easy talkin&#8217;, gentle old party, willin&#8217; to tell all
he knew in the first five minutes, Chunk
wouldn&#8217;t have bothered with him; but, because
he don&#8217;t show any gratitude, mushy or otherwise,
and acts like he had a permanent, ingrowin&#8217;
grouch, Chunk is right there with the
persistence. He drags out of him that he&#8217;s
Cap&#8217;n Todd Spiller, hailin&#8217; originally from
Castine, Maine, and that the name of his old
tub is the Queen of the Seas. He says his chief
business is clammin&#8217;; but he does a little fishin&#8217;
and freightin&#8217; on the side. He don&#8217;t work
much, though, because it don&#8217;t take a lot to
keep him.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have a wife somewhere ashore,
I suppose,&#8221; suggests Chunk, &#8220;a dear old
soul who waits anxiously for you to come
back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; grunts Cap&#8217;n Spiller, knockin&#8217; the
heel out of his corncob vicious. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t got
any use for women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; says Chunk, gazin&#8217; up sentimental
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
at the moon. &#8220;A blighted romance of youth;
some fair, fickle maid who fled with another and
left you alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No such luck,&#8221; says Spiller. &#8220;My trouble
was havin&#8217; too many to once. Drat &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>And you&#8217;d most thought Chunk would have
let it go at that; but not him! He only tackles
Spiller along another line. &#8220;What I want to
know, Captain,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is where you learned
to play the accordion so well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never learned &#8217;tall,&#8221; growls Spiller.
&#8220;Just picked it up from a Portugee that tried
to knife me afterwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say!&#8221; says Chunk. &#8220;But
there&#8217;s the musician&#8217;s soul in you. You love
it, don&#8217;t you? You use it to express your deep,
unsatisfied longings?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess so,&#8221; says the Captain. &#8220;I allus
plays most when my dyspepshy is worst. It&#8217;s
kind of a relief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um-m-m&mdash;ah!&#8221; says Chunk. &#8220;Many
geniuses are that way. You must come into
town, though, and let me take you to hear some
real, bang up, classical music.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not me!&#8221; grunts Spiller. &#8220;I can make
all the music I want myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about plays, then?&#8221; says Chunk.
&#8220;Now, wouldn&#8217;t you like to see the best show
on Broadway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; says he, prompt and vigorous.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t never seen any shows, and don&#8217;t want
to seen one, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, say, along about that time, what with
the stale cookin&#8217; and bilge water scents that
was comin&#8217; from the stuffy cabin, and this
charmin&#8217; mood that old Spiller was in, I was
gettin&#8217; restless. &#8220;Say, Chunk,&#8221; I breaks in,
&#8220;you may be enjoyin&#8217; this, all right; but I&#8217;ve
got enough. It&#8217;s me for shore! Goin&#8217;
along?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Have the boat come
back for me in about an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was nearer two, though, before he shows
up again, and his face is fairly beamin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says I, &#8220;did you adopt the old
pirate, or did he adopt you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait and see,&#8221; says he, noddin&#8217; his head
cocky. &#8220;Anyway, he&#8217;s promised to show up
at my office to-morrow afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be stuck on entertaining a
grouchy old lemon like that,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s a genius,&#8221; says Chunk. &#8220;Just
what I&#8217;ve been looking for as a head liner in
a new vaudeville house I&#8217;m opening next
month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; says I. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t thinkin&#8217; of
puttin&#8217; that old sour face on the stage, are
you? Say, you&#8217;re batty!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Batty, am I?&#8221; says Chunk, kind of swellin&#8217;
up. &#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll show you. I&#8217;ve made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
half a million, my boy, by just such batty
moves as that. It&#8217;s because I know people,
know &#8217;em through and through, from what
they&#8217;ll pay to hear, to the ones who can give
&#8217;em what they want. I&#8217;m a discoverer of talent,
Shorty. Where do I get my stars from?
Pick &#8217;em up anywhere. I don&#8217;t go to London
and Paris and pay fancy salaries. I find my
attractions first hand, sign&#8217; em up on long
contracts, and take the velvet that comes in
myself. That&#8217;s my way, and I guess I&#8217;ve made
good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you have,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but I&#8217;m
guessin&#8217; this is where you stub your toe. Hot
line that&#8217;ll be for the head of a bill, won&#8217;t it&mdash;an
accordion player? Think you can get that
across?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think!&#8221; says Chunk, gettin&#8217; indignant as
usual, because someone suggests he can fall
down on anything. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;m going to put
that over twice a day, to twelve hundred-dollar
houses! No, I don&#8217;t think; I know!&#8221;</p>
<p>And just for that it wouldn&#8217;t have taken
much urgin&#8217; for me to have put up a few
yellow ones that he was makin&#8217; a wrong forecast.</p>
<p>But, say, you didn&#8217;t happen to be up to the
openin&#8217; of Peter K.&#8217;s new Alcazar the other
night, did you? Well, Sadie and I was, on
account of being included in one of Chunk&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
complimentary box parties. And, honest, when
they sprung that clouded moonlight water view,
with the Long Island lights in the distance, and
the Sound steamers passin&#8217; back and forth
at the back, and the rocks in front, hanged if I
didn&#8217;t feel like I was on the veranda of our
yacht club, watchin&#8217; it all over again, the same
as it was that night!</p>
<p>Then in from one side comes this boat; no
ordinary property piece faked up from something
in stock; but a life sized model that&#8217;s a
dead ringer for the old Queen of the Seas,
even to the stovepipe and the shirts hung from
the forestay. It comes floatin&#8217; in lazy and
natural, and when Cap Spiller goes forward
to heave over the anchor he drops it with a
splash into real water. He&#8217;s wearin&#8217; the same
old costume,&mdash;shirt sleeves, cob pipe, and all,&mdash;and
when he begins to putter around in the
cabin, blamed if you couldn&#8217;t smell the onions
fryin&#8217; and the coffee boilin&#8217;. Yes, sir, Chunk
had put it all on!</p>
<p>Did the act get &#8217;em interested? Say, there
was fifteen straight minutes of this scenic business,
with not a word said; but the house was
so still I could hear my watch tickin&#8217;. But
when he drags out that old accordion, plants
himself on the cabin roof with one leg swingin&#8217;
careless over the side, and opens up with them
old tunes of his&mdash;well, he had &#8217;em all with him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
from the messenger boys in the twenty-five-cent
gallery to the brokers in the fifteen-dollar
boxes. He takes five curtain calls, and the orchestra
circle was still demandin&#8217; more when
they rung down the front drop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chunk,&#8221; says I, as he shows up at our
box, &#8220;I take it back. You sure have picked
another winner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like it, don&#8217;t it?&#8221; says he. &#8220;And
whisper! A fifty-minute act for a hundred a
week! That&#8217;s the best of it. Up at the Columbus
their top liner is costing them a thousand
a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cinch if you can hold onto him, eh?&#8221;
says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can hold him all right,&#8221; says Chunk,
waggin&#8217; his head confident. &#8220;I know enough
about human nature to be sure of that. Of
course, he&#8217;s an odd freak; but this sort of thing
will grow on him. The oftener he gets a hand
like that, the more he&#8217;ll want it, and inside of
a fortnight that&#8217;ll be what he lives for. Oh,
I know people, from the ground up, inside and
outside!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I was beginnin&#8217; to think he did. And,
havin&#8217; been on the inside of his deal, I got to
takin&#8217; a sort of pride in this hit, almost as
much as if I&#8217;d discovered the Captain myself.
I used to go up about every afternoon to see
old Spiller do his stunt and get &#8217;em goin&#8217;.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
Gen&#8217;rally I&#8217;d lug along two or three friends,
so I could tell &#8217;em how it happened.</p>
<p>Last Friday I was a little late for the act,
and was just rushin&#8217; by the boxoffice, when I
hears language floatin&#8217; out that I recognizes
as a brand that only Chunk Tracey could deliver
when he was good and warm under
the collar. Peekin&#8217; in through the window,
I sees him standin&#8217; there, fairly tearin&#8217; his
hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up, Chunk?&#8221; says I. &#8220;You seem
peeved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Peeved!&#8221; he yells. &#8220;Why, blankety blank
the scousy universe, I&#8217;m stark, raving mad!
What do you think? Spiller has quit!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody overbid that hundred a week?&#8221;
says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish they had; then I could get out an
injunction and hold him on his contract,&#8221; says
Peter K. &#8220;But he&#8217;s skipped, skipped for
good. Read that.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only a scrawly note he&#8217;d left pinned up
in his dressin&#8217; room, and, while it ain&#8217;t much
as a specimen of flowery writin&#8217;, it states his
case more or less clear. Here&#8217;s what it said:</p>
<p>Mister P. K. Tracey;</p>
<p>Sir:&mdash;I&#8217;m through being a fool actor. The money&#8217;s all right if
I needed it, which I doant, but I doant like makin&#8217; a fool of
myself twict a day to please a lot of citty foalks I doant give a dam
about annie way, I doant like livin&#8217; in a blamed hotel either, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
there aint annie wheres to set and smoak and see the sun come
up. I&#8217;d ruther be on my old bote, and that&#8217;s whare I&#8217;m goin&#8217;.
You needn&#8217;t try to find me and git me to come back for I wont.
You couldn&#8217;t git me to act on that staige agin, ever. It&#8217;s
foolish.</p>
<p>Yours,
<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Todd Spiller</span>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what in the name of all that&#8217;s woolly,&#8221;
says Chunk, &#8220;would you say to a thing like
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; says I. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Maybe I&#8217;d
start in by admittin&#8217; that to card index the
minds of the whole human race was a good deal
of a job for one party to tackle, even with a
mighty intellect like yours. Also, if it was put
up to me flat, I might agree with Spiller.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>HANDING BOBBY A BLANK</h3>
</div>

<p>Say, what do you make out of this plute
huntin&#8217; business, anyway? Has the big money
bunch got us down on the mat with our wind
shut off and our pockets inside out; or is it
just campaign piffle? Are we ghost dancin&#8217;,
or waltz dreamin&#8217;, or what? It sure has me
twisted up for fair, and I don&#8217;t know whether
I stand with the criminal rich or the predatory
poor.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all on account of a little mix-up I was
rung into at the hotel Perzazzer the other day.
No, we ain&#8217;t livin&#8217; there reg&#8217;lar again. This
was just a little fall vacation we was takin&#8217; in
town, so Sadie can catch up with her shoppin&#8217;,
and of course the Perzazzer seems more or
less like home to us.</p>
<p>But it ain&#8217;t often I&#8217;ve ever run against anything
like this there. I&#8217;ve been thinkin&#8217; it over
since, and it&#8217;s left me with my feet in the air.
No, you didn&#8217;t read anything about it in the
papers. But say, there&#8217;s more goes on in one
of them big joints every week than would fill
a whole issue.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>Look at the population the Perzazzer&#8217;s got,&mdash;over
two thousand, countin&#8217; the help! Why,
drop us down somewhere out in Iowa, and
spread us around in separate houses, and
there&#8217;d be enough to call for a third-class postmaster,
a police force, and a board of trade.
Bunched the way we are, all up and down seventeen
stories, with every cubic foot accounted
for, we don&#8217;t cut much of a figure except on the
checkbooks. You hear about the Perzazzer
only when some swell gives a fancy blow-out,
or a guest gets frisky in the public dining
room.</p>
<p>And anything in the shape of noise soon has
the muffler put on it. We&#8217;ve got a whole squad
of husky, two-handed, soft spoken gents who
don&#8217;t have anything else to do, and our champeen
ruction extinguisher is Danny Reardon.
To see him strollin&#8217; through the café, you might
think he was a corporation lawyer studyin&#8217; how
to spend his next fee; but let some ambitious
wine opener put on the loud pedal, or have
Danny get his eye on some Bridgeport dressmaker
drawin&#8217; designs of the latest Paris
fashions in the tea room, and you&#8217;ll see him
wake up. Nothing seems to get by him.</p>
<p>So I was some surprised to find him havin&#8217;
an argument with a couple of parties away
up on our floor. Anyone could see with one
eye that they was a pair of butt-ins. The tall,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
smooth faced gent in the black frock coat and
the white tie had sky pilot wrote all over him;
and the Perzazzer ain&#8217;t just the place an out
of town minister would pick out to stop at,
unless he wanted to blow a year&#8217;s salary into
a week&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Anyway, his runnin&#8217; mate was a dead give
away. He looked like he might have just left
a bench in the Oriental lodgin&#8217; house down at
Chatham Square. He&#8217;s a thin, gawky, pale
haired youth, with tired eyes and a limp lower
jaw that leaves his mouth half open all the
time; and his costume looks like it had been
made up from back door contributions,&mdash;a
faded coat three sizes too small, a forty fat
vest, and a pair of shiny black whipcord pants
that someone had been married in about twenty
years back.</p>
<p>What gets me is why such a specimen should
be trailin&#8217; around with a clean, decent lookin&#8217;
chap like this minister. Maybe that&#8217;s why I
come to take any notice of their little debate.
There&#8217;s some men, though, that you always
give a second look at, and this minister gent
was one of that kind. It wa&#8217;n&#8217;t until I see
how he tops Danny by a head that I notices
how well built he is; and I figures that if he
was only in condition, and knew how to handle
himself, he could put up a good lively scrap.
Something about his jaw hints that to me; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
of course, him bein&#8217; a Bible pounder, I don&#8217;t
expect anything of the kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand all that,&#8221; Danny was
tellin&#8217; him; &#8220;but you&#8217;d better come down to
the office, just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear man,&#8221; says the minister, &#8220;I have
been to the office, as I told you before, and I
could get no satisfaction there. The person I
wish to see is on the ninth floor. They say he
is out. I doubt it, and, as I have come six
hundred miles just to have a word with him, I
insist on a chance to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; says Danny. &#8220;You&#8217;ll get your
chance, only it&#8217;s against the rules to allow
strangers above the ground floor. Now, you
come along with me and you&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221;
With that Danny gets a grip on the gent&#8217;s arm
and starts to walk him to the elevator. But he
don&#8217;t go far. The next thing Danny knows he&#8217;s
been sent spinnin&#8217; against the other wall.
Course, he wa&#8217;n&#8217;t lookin&#8217; for any such move;
but it was done slick and prompt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; says the minister, shovin&#8217; his cuffs
back in place; &#8220;but I must ask you to keep
your hands off.&#8221;</p>
<p>I see what Danny was up to then. He looks
as cool as a soda fountain; but he&#8217;s red behind
his ears, and he&#8217;s fishin&#8217; the chain nippers out
of his side pocket. I knows that in about a
minute the gent in the frock coat will have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
both hands out of business. Even at that, it
looks like an even bet, with somebody gettin&#8217;
hurt more or less. And blamed if I didn&#8217;t
hate to see that spunky minister get mussed up,
just for objectin&#8217; to takin&#8217; the quiet run out.
So I pushes to the front.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; says I, shovin&#8217; out a hand
to the parson, as though he was someone I&#8217;d
been lookin&#8217; for. &#8220;So you showed up, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; says he,&mdash;&#8220;why&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; says I, headin&#8217; him off.
&#8220;You can tell me about that later. Bring your
friend right in; this is my door. It&#8217;s all right,
Danny; mistakes will happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>And before any of &#8217;em knows what&#8217;s up,
Danny is left outside with his mouth open, while
I&#8217;ve towed the pair of strays into our sittin&#8217;
room, and shooed Sadie out of the way. The
minister looks kind of dazed; but he keeps his
head well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; says he, gazin&#8217; around, &#8220;I am
sure there must be some misunderstanding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet,&#8221; says I, &#8220;and it was gettin&#8217;
worse every minute. About two shakes more,
and you&#8217;d been the center of a local disturbance
that would have landed you before the police
sergeant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that I cannot
communicate with a guest in this hotel without
being liable to arrest?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the size of it,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Danny
had the bracelets all out. The conundrum is,
though, Why I should do the goat act, instead
of lettin&#8217; you two mix it up? But that&#8217;s what
happened, and now I guess it&#8217;s up to you to
give an account.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; says he. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t quite clear;
but I infer that you have, in a way, made yourself
responsible for me. May I ask whom I
have to thank for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Shorty McCabe,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; says he. &#8220;It seems to me I&#8217;ve
heard&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing like bein&#8217; well advertised,&#8221; says
I. &#8220;Now, how about you&mdash;and this?&#8221; With
that I points to the specimen in the cast offs,
that was givin&#8217; an imitation of a flytrap. It was
a little crisp, I admit; but I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; anxious
to know where I stand.</p>
<p>The minister lifts his eyebrows some, but
proceeds to hand out the information. &#8220;My
name is Hooker,&#8221; says he,&mdash;&#8220;Samuel Hooker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Preacher?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-es, a poor one,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Where?
Well, in the neighborhood of Mossy Dell, Pennsylvania.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out in the celluloid collar belt, eh?&#8221; says
I. &#8220;This ain&#8217;t a deacon, is it?&#8221; and I jerks
my thumb at the fish eyed one.</p>
<p>&#8220;This unfortunate fellow,&#8221; says he, droppin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
a hand on the object&#8217;s shoulder, &#8220;is one of our
industrial products. His name is Kronacher,
commonly called Dummy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can guess why,&#8221; says I. &#8220;But now let&#8217;s
get down to how you two happen to be loose
on the seventh floor of the Perzazzer and so
far from Mossy Dell.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Reverend Sam says there ain&#8217;t any great
mystery about that. He come on here special
to have a talk with a party by the name of
Rankin, that he understood was stoppin&#8217; here.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean Bobby Brut, do you?&#8221;
says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Robert K. Rankin is the young man&#8217;s name,
I believe,&#8221; says he,&mdash;&#8220;son of the late Loring
Rankin, president of the Consolidated&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Bobby Brut,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
catch onto the Brut, eh? You would if you
read the champagne labels. Friend of yours,
is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>But right there the Rev. Mr. Hooker turns
balky. He hints that his business with Bobby
is private and personal, and he ain&#8217;t anxious
to lay it before a third party. He&#8217;d told &#8217;em
the same at the desk, when someone from
Bobbie&#8217;s rooms had &#8217;phoned for details about
the card, and then he&#8217;d got the turn down.
But he wa&#8217;n&#8217;t the kind that stayed down. He&#8217;s
goin&#8217; to see Mr. Rankin or bu&#8217;st. Not wantin&#8217;
to ask for the elevator, he blazes ahead up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
stairs; and Danny, it seems, hadn&#8217;t got on his
track until he was well started.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I ask,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is five minutes of
Mr. Rankin&#8217;s time. That is not an unreasonable
request, I hope?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but you&#8217;re missin&#8217;
the point by a mile. It ain&#8217;t how long you
want to stay, but what you&#8217;re here for. You
got to remember that things is run different
on Fifth-ave. from what they are on Penrose-st.,
Mossy Dell. You might be a book agent,
or a bomb thrower, for all the folks at the desk
know. So the only way to get next to anyone
here is to show your hand and take the decision.
Now if you want to try runnin&#8217; the
outside guard again, I&#8217;ll call Danny back. But
you&#8217;ll make a mess of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thinks that over for a minute, lookin&#8217;
me square in the eye all the time, and all of a
sudden he puts out his hand. &#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221;
says he. &#8220;I was hot headed, and let my zeal
get the better of my commonsense. Thank
you, Mr. McCabe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; says I. &#8220;You go down
to the office and put your case to &#8217;em straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says he, shruggin&#8217; his shoulders,
&#8220;that wouldn&#8217;t do at all. I suppose I&#8217;ve come
on a fool&#8217;s errand. Kronacher, we&#8217;ll go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; says I, &#8220;if you had business
with Bobby that was on the level.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Since you&#8217;ve been so kind,&#8221; says he, &#8220;perhaps
you would give me your opinion&mdash;if I am
not detaining you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spiel away!&#8221; says I. &#8220;I&#8217;ll own up you&#8217;ve
got me some interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, say, when he&#8217;d described his visit as a
dippy excursion, he wa&#8217;n&#8217;t far off. Seems that
this Rev. Sam Hooker ain&#8217;t a reg&#8217;lar preacher,
with a stained glass window church, a steam
heated parsonage, and a settled job. He&#8217;s sort
of a Gospel promoter, that goes around plantin&#8217;
churches here and there,&mdash;home missionary, he
calls it, though I always thought a home missionary
was one that was home from China on
a half-pay visit.</p>
<p>Mainly he says he drifts around through the
coke oven and glass works district, where all
the Polackers and other dagoes work. He don&#8217;t
let it go with preachin&#8217; to &#8217;em, though. He
pokes around among their shacks, seein&#8217; how
they live, sendin&#8217; doctors for sick babies, givin&#8217;
the women folks hints on the use of fresh air
and hard soap, an&#8217; advisin&#8217; &#8217;em to keep their
kids in school. He&#8217;s one of them strenuous
chaps, too, that believes in stirrin&#8217; up a fuss
whenever he runs across anything he thinks
is wrong. One of the fights he&#8217;s been making
is something about the boys in the glass
works.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you have heard of our efforts to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
have a child labor bill passed in our State?&#8221;
says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but I&#8217;m against it. There&#8217;s
enough kids has to answer the mill whistle,
without passin&#8217; laws to make &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he explains how the bill is to keep &#8217;em
from goin&#8217; at it too young, or workin&#8217; too many
hours on a stretch. Course, I&#8217;m with him on
that, and says so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; says he. &#8220;Then you may be interested
to learn that young Mr. Rankin is the
most extensive employer of child labor in our
State. That is what I want to talk to him
about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever see Bobby?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>He says he hasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;Know anything of his habits, and so on?&#8221;
I asks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing,&#8221; says the Rev. Sam.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you take it from me,&#8221; says I, &#8220;that
you ain&#8217;t missed much.&#8221;</p>
<p>See? I couldn&#8217;t go all over that record of
Bobby Brut&#8217;s, specially to a preacher. Not
that Bobby was the worst that ever cruised
around the Milky Way in a sea goin&#8217; cab with
his feet over the dasher; but he was something
of a torrid proposition while he lasted. You
remember some of his stunts, maybe? I hadn&#8217;t
kept strict tabs on him; but I&#8217;d heard that after
they chucked him out of the sanatorium his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
mother planted him here, with a man nurse
and a private doctor, and slid off to Europe to
stay with her son-in-law Count until folks forgot
about Bobby.</p>
<p>And this was the youth the Rev. Mr. Hooker
had come to have a heart to heart talk with!</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you takin&#8217; a lot of trouble, just for
a few Polackers?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are my brothers,&#8221; says he, quiet like.</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; says I. &#8220;You don&#8217;t look it.&#8221;</p>
<p>His mouth corners flickers a little at that,
and there comes a glimmer in them solemn gray
eyes of his; but he goes on to say that it&#8217;s
part of his belief that every man is his brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; says I. &#8220;You&#8217;ve adopted a big
fam&#8217;ly.&#8221;</p>
<p>But say, he&#8217;s so dead in earnest about it, and
he talks so sensible about other things, besides
appearin&#8217; so white clear through, that I can&#8217;t
help likin&#8217; the cuss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; says I. &#8220;This is way out of
my line, and it strikes me as a batty proposition
anyway; but if you&#8217;re still anxious to have a
chin with Bobby, maybe I can fix it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, thank you!&#8221; says he, givin&#8217;
me the grateful grip.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good deal easier than I&#8217;d thought.
All I does is get one of Bobby&#8217;s retinue on the
house &#8217;phone, tell who I am, and say I was
thinkin&#8217; of droppin&#8217; up with a couple of friends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
for a short call, if Bobby&#8217;s agreeable. Seems
he was, for inside of two minutes we&#8217;re on our
way up in the elevator.</p>
<p>Got any idea of the simple way a half baked
young plute can live in a place like the Perzazzer?
He has one floor of a whole wing cut off
for his special use,&mdash;about twenty rooms, I
should judge,&mdash;and there was hired hands
standin&#8217; around in every corner. We&#8217;re piloted
in over the Persian rugs, with the preacher
blinkin&#8217; his eyes to keep from seein&#8217; some of
the statuary and oil paintin&#8217;s.</p>
<p>At last we comes to a big room with an
eastern exposure, furnished like a show window.
Sittin&#8217; at a big mahogany table in the
middle is a narrow browed, pop eyed, bat eared
young chap in a padded silk dressin&#8217; gown, and
I remembers him for the Bobby Brut I used
to see floatin&#8217; around with the Trixy-Madges
at the lobster palaces. He has a couple of decks
of cards laid out in front of him, and I guesses
he&#8217;s havin&#8217; a go at Canfield solitaire. Behind
his chair stands a sour faced lackey who holds
up his hand for us to wait.</p>
<p>Bobby don&#8217;t look up at all. He&#8217;s shiftin&#8217;
the cards around, tryin&#8217; to make &#8217;em come out
right, doin&#8217; it quick and nervous. All of a
sudden the lackey claps his hand down on a pile
and says, &#8220;Beg pardon, sir, but you can&#8217;t do
that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Blast you!&#8221; snarls Bobby. &#8220;And I was
just getting it! Why didn&#8217;t you look the other
way? Bah!&#8221; and he sends the whole lot flyin&#8217;
on the floor. Do you catch on? He has the
lackey there to see that he don&#8217;t cheat himself.</p>
<p>But while the help was pickin&#8217; up the cards
Bobby gets a glimpse of our trio, ranged up
against the door draperies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Shorty McCabe!&#8221; he sings out.
&#8220;It&#8217;s bully of you to drop in. Nobody comes
to see me any more&mdash;hardly a soul. Say, do
you think there&#8217;s anything the matter with
my head?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say your nut shows any cracks from
here,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Who&#8217;s been tellin&#8217; you it
did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, all those blasted doctors,&#8221; says he.
&#8220;They won&#8217;t even let me go out alone. But
say,&#8221; here he beckons me up and whispers mysterious,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix &#8217;em yet! You just wait till
I get my animals trained. You wait!&#8221; Then
he claps his hands and hollers, &#8220;Atkins! Set
&#8217;em going!&#8221;</p>
<p>Atkins, he stops scrabblin&#8217; after the cards
and starts around the room. And say, would
you believe it, on all the tables and mantelpieces
was a lot of those toy animals, such as they sell
durin&#8217; the holidays. There was lions and tigers
and elephants, little and big, and every last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
one of &#8217;em has its head balanced so it&#8217;ll move
up and down when you touch it. Atkins&#8217; job
was to go from one to the other and set &#8217;em
bobbin&#8217;. Them on the mantels wa&#8217;n&#8217;t more&#8217;n
a few inches long; but on the floor, hid behind
chairs, was some that was life size. One was
a tiger, made out of a real skin, and when his
head goes his jaws open and shut, and his tail
lashes from side to side, as natural as life.
Say, it was weird to watch that collection, all
noddin&#8217; away together&mdash;almost gave you the
willies!</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they all going?&#8221; says Bobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; says Atkins, standin&#8217; attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think, eh?&#8221; says Bobbie,
half shuttin&#8217; his pop eyes and starin&#8217; at me,
real foxy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great scheme!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t know
you had a private zoo up here. But say, I
brought along someone that wants to have a
little chin with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that I hauls the Rev. Sam to the
front and gives him the nudge to fire away.
And say, he&#8217;s all primed! He begins by givin&#8217;
Bobbie a word picture of the Rankin glass
works at night, when the helpers are carryin&#8217;
the trays from the hot room, where the blowers
work three-hour shifts, with the mercury at
one hundred and twenty, to the coolin&#8217; room,
where it&#8217;s like a cellar. He tells him how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
many helpers there are, how many hours they
work a day, and what they get for it. It didn&#8217;t
make me yearn for a job.</p>
<p>&#8220;And here,&#8221; says the Rev. Mr. Hooker,
pullin&#8217; the Dummy up by the sleeve, &#8220;is what
happens. This boy went to work in your glass
factory when he was thirteen. He was red
cheeked, clear eyed, then, and he had a normal
brain. He held his job six years. Then he
was discharged. Why? Because he wasn&#8217;t of
any more use. He was all in, the juice sapped
out of him, as dry as a last year&#8217;s cornhusk.
Look at him! Any doubt about his being used
up? And what happened to him is happening
to thousands of other boys. So I have come
here to ask you, Mr. Rankin, if you are proud
of turning out such products? Aren&#8217;t you
ready to stop hiring thirteen-year-old boys for
your works?&#8221;</p>
<p>Say, it was straight from the shoulder, that
talk,&mdash;no flourishes, no fine words! And what
do you guess Bobby Brut has to say? Not a
blamed thing! I doubt if he heard more&#8217;n
half of it, anyway; for he&#8217;s got his eyes set
on that pasty face of Dummy Kronacher, and
is followin&#8217; his motions.</p>
<p>The Dummy ain&#8217;t payin&#8217; any attention to the
speech, either. He&#8217;s got sight of all them animals
with their heads bobbin&#8217;, and a silly grin
spreads over his face. First he sidles over to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
the mantel and touches up one that was about
stopped. Then he sees another, and starts that
off again, and by the time Hooker is through
the Dummy is as busy and contented as you
please, keepin&#8217; them tigers and things movin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; says the Rev. Sam.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says Bobby, tearin&#8217; his eyes off the
Dummy. &#8220;Were you saying something about
the glass works? Beastly bore! I never go
near them. But say! I want that chap over
there. I want to hire him. What&#8217;s his name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dummy Kronacher,&#8221; says the Rev. Sam,
comin&#8217; out strong on the first word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; says Bobbie. &#8220;Hey, Dummy?
What will you take to stay here with me and
do that right along?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dummy has just discovered a stuffed alligator
that can snap its jaws and wiggle its tail.
He only looks up and grins.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it a hundred a month,&#8221; says
Bobbie. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s settled. Atkins, you&#8217;re
fired! And say, McCabe, I must show this new
man how I want this business done. You and
your friend run in some other time, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; says Hooker, &#8220;can&#8217;t you do something
about those helpers? Won&#8217;t you promise
to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; snaps Bobby. &#8220;I&#8217;ve no time to
bother with such things. Atkins, show &#8217;em
out!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>Well, we went. We goes so sudden the Rev.
Sam forgets about leavin&#8217; the Dummy until
we&#8217;re outside, and then he&#8217;s for goin&#8217; back
after him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; says I. &#8220;That pair&#8217;ll get
along fine; they&#8217;re two of a kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right,&#8221; says he. &#8220;And
it&#8217;s something to have brought those two together.
Perhaps someone will see the significance
of it, some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now what was he drivin&#8217; at then? You can
search me. All I&#8217;ve been able to make out of
it is that what ails the poor is poverty, and the
trouble with the plutes is that they&#8217;ve got too
much. Eh? Barney Shaw said something like
that too? Well, don&#8217;t let on I agree with him.
He might get chesty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>MARMADUKE SLIPS ONE OVER</h3>
</div>

<p>And you&#8217;d almost think I could accumulate
enough freaks, all by myself, without havin&#8217; my
friends pass theirs along, wouldn&#8217;t you? Yet
lemme tell you what Pinckney rung up on me.</p>
<p>He comes into the Studio one day towin&#8217; a
party who wears brown spats and a brown ribbon
to his shell rimmed eyeglasses, and leaves
him planted in a chair over by the window,
where he goes to rubbin&#8217; his chin with a silver-handled
stick while we dive into the gym. for
one of our little half-hour sessions. Leaves
him there without sayin&#8217; a word, mind you, like
you&#8217;d stand an umbrella in the corner!</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the silent gazooks you run on the
siding out front?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; says Pinckney, &#8220;that&#8217;s only Marmaduke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only!&#8221; says I. &#8220;I should say Marmaduke
was quite some of a name. Anything behind
it? He ain&#8217;t a blank, is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who, Marmaduke?&#8221; says he. &#8220;Far from
it! In fact, he has a most individual personality.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds good,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but does it
mean anything? Who is he, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask him, Shorty, ask him,&#8221; says Pinckney,
and as he turns to put his coat on the hanger
I gets a glimpse of that merry eye-twinkle of
his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on&mdash;I&#8217;m easy,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I&#8217;d look nice,
wouldn&#8217;t I, holdin&#8217; a perfect stranger up for his
pedigree?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I assure you he&#8217;d be pleased to give it,&#8221;
says Pinckney, &#8220;and, more than that, I want
to be there to hear it myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re apt to strain your ears some
listenin&#8217;,&#8221; says I. &#8220;This ain&#8217;t my day for
askin&#8217; fool questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>You never can tell, though. We hadn&#8217;t much
more&#8217;n got through our mitt exercise, and
Pinckney was only half into his afternoon tea
uniform, when there&#8217;s a &#8217;phone call for him.
And the next thing I know he&#8217;s hustled into his
frock coat and rushed out.</p>
<p>Must have been five minutes later when I
fin&#8217;lly strolls into the front office, to find that
mysterious Marmaduke is still holdin&#8217; down the
chair and gazin&#8217; placid out onto 42d-st. It
looks like he&#8217;d been forgotten and hadn&#8217;t noticed
the fact.</p>
<p>One of these long, loose jointed, languid actin&#8217;
gents, Marmaduke is; the kind that can drape
themselves careless and comf&#8217;table over almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
any kind of furniture. He&#8217;s a little pop eyed,
his hair is sort of a faded tan color, and he&#8217;s
whopper jawed on the left side; but beyond that
he didn&#8217;t have any striking points of facial
beauty. It&#8217;s what you might call an interestin&#8217;
mug, though, and it&#8217;s so full of repose that it
seems almost a shame to disturb him.</p>
<p>Someone had to notify him, though, that he&#8217;d
overslept. I tried clearin&#8217; my throat and shufflin&#8217;
my feet to bring him to; but that gets no
action at all. So there was nothing for it but
to go over and tap him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; says I, &#8220;but your friend
has gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, quite so,&#8221; says he, still starin&#8217; out of
the window and rubbin&#8217; his chin. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a way
friends have. They come, and they go. Quite
so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody&#8217;s debatin&#8217; that point,&#8221; says I;
&#8220;but just now I wa&#8217;n&#8217;t speakin&#8217; of friends in
gen&#8217;ral. I was referrin&#8217; to Pinckney. He
didn&#8217;t leave any word; but I suspicion he was
called up by&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; breaks in Marmaduke. &#8220;I know.
Mrs. Purdy-Pell consults him about dinner favors&mdash;tremendous
trifles, to be coped with only
by a trained intelligence. We meet at the club
later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s it, is it?&#8221; says I. &#8220;In that case,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
make yourself to home. Have an evening paper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please take it away,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I might
be tempted to read about the beastly stock
market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Been taking a little flyer, eh?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, I?&#8221; says he. &#8220;Why, I haven&#8217;t
enough cash to buy a decent dinner. But everybody
you meet follows the market, you know.
It&#8217;s a contagious disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ve been exposed a
lot and haven&#8217;t caught it very hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gifted of the gods!&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Marmaduke, you know,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that much,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;To him that hath ears&mdash;mufflers,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mufflers?&#8221; says I. &#8220;I guess I must be
missin&#8217; some of my cues, Mister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never care,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Why cry over
spilt milk when one can keep a cat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Are you stringin&#8217;
me, or am I stringin&#8217; you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of what use to fret the oracle?&#8221; says he.
&#8220;They say silence is golden&mdash;well, I&#8217;ve spent
mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, say, he had me doin&#8217; the spiral dip at
that. I don&#8217;t mind indulgin&#8217; in a little foolish
conversation now and then; but I hate to have
it so one sided. And, honest, so far as I figured,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
he might have been readin&#8217; the label off a tea
chest. So with that I counters with one of my
rough and ready comebacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marmaduke&mdash;did you say it was?&#8221; says I.
&#8220;If you did, where&#8217;s the can?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove! That&#8217;s rather good, though!&#8221;
says he, rappin&#8217; the floor with his stick. &#8220;A
little crude; but the element is there. Brava!
Bravissimo!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stirred up the pigeons, anyway,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pigeons?&#8221; says he, lookin&#8217; puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; says I. &#8220;And he wants a
diagram for that mossy one! Loft, you know,&#8221;
and I taps my forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost worthy of my steel!&#8221; says he,
jumpin&#8217; up and shovin&#8217; out his hand. &#8220;Well
met, Brother!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know which of us has a call to get
chesty over it; but here&#8217;s how,&#8221; says I, takin&#8217;
the friendly palm he holds out. &#8220;Seein&#8217; it&#8217;s
gone this far, though, maybe you&#8217;ll tell me who
in blazes you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>And there I&#8217;d gone and done just what Pinckney
had egged me to do. Course, the minute I
asked the question I knew I&#8217;d given him a chance
to slip one over on me; but I wa&#8217;n&#8217;t lookin&#8217; for
quite such a double jointed jolt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who am I?&#8221; says he. &#8220;Does it matter?
Well, if it does, I am easily accounted for. Behold
an anachronism!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A which?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;An anachronism,&#8221; says he once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I pass,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Is it part of Austria, or
just a nickname for some alfalfa district out
West?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brave ventures,&#8221; says he; &#8220;but vain.
One&#8217;s place of birth doesn&#8217;t count if one&#8217;s
twentieth century mind has a sixteenth century
attitude. That&#8217;s my trouble; or else I&#8217;m plain
lazy, which I don&#8217;t in the least admit. Do you
follow me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dizzy from it,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;The confession is aptly put,&#8221; he goes on,
&#8220;and the frankness of it does you credit. But
I perceive. You would class me by peg and
hole. Well, I&#8217;m no peg for any hole. I don&#8217;t
fit. On the floor of life&#8217;s great workshop I just
kick around. There you have me&mdash;ah&mdash;what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but take my advice and
don&#8217;t ever spring that description on any desk
Sergeant. It may be good; but it sounds like
loose bearin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; says he. &#8220;The metaphor of to-morrow!
Speak on, Sir Galahad!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I know it&#8217;s runnin&#8217;
a risk; but I&#8217;ll chance one more: What part of
the map do you hail from, Marmaduke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My proper home,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is the Forest
of Arden; but where that is I know not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; says I, &#8220;then you belong in the new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
Harriman State Park. Anyway, there&#8217;s a station
by that name out on the Erie road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rails never ran to Arden Wood,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;nor ever will. Selah!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like an old song,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Are
you taken this way often?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Marmaduke, you know,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, that&#8217;s where we begun,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but
it&#8217;s as far as we got. Is bein&#8217; Marmaduke your
steady job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some would call it so,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I try to
make of it an art.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You win,&#8221; says I. &#8220;What can I set
up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Pinckney has thoughtlessly
taken his cigarette case with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I sends Swifty out for a box of the most
expensive dope sticks he can find. Maybe it
wouldn&#8217;t strike everybody that way; but to me
it seemed like bein&#8217; entertained at cut rates.
Next to havin&#8217; a happy dream about nothing I
could remember afterwards, I guess this repartee
bout with Marmaduke gets the ribbon. It
was like blowin&#8217; soap bubbles to music,&mdash;sort
of soothin&#8217; and cheerin&#8217; and no wear and
tear on the brain. He stayed until closin&#8217;
up time, and I was almost sorry to have
him go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come around again,&#8221; says I, &#8220;when the
fog is thinner.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m certain to,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I&#8217;m Marmaduke,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the curious thing about that remark was
that after you&#8217;d heard it four or five times it
filled the bill. I didn&#8217;t want to know any more,
and it was only because Pinckney insisted on
givin&#8217; me the details that the mystery was partly
cleared up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says he, &#8220;what did you think of
Marmaduke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither of us did any thinkin&#8217;,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I
just watched the butterflies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You what?&#8221; says Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, call &#8217;em bats, then!&#8221; says I. &#8220;He&#8217;s
got a dome full.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you thought Marmaduke a bit
off?&#8221; says he. &#8220;Nothing of the kind, Shorty.
Why, he&#8217;s a brilliant chap,&mdash;Oxford, Heidelberg,
and all that sort of thing. He&#8217;s written
plays that no one will put on, books that no one
will publish, and composed music that few can
understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can believe it,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Also he can use
language that he invents as he goes along. Entertainin&#8217;
cuss, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A philosopher soufflé,&#8221; says Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it pay him well?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no joke,&#8221; says Pinckney. &#8220;The little
his father left him is gone, and what&#8217;s coming
from his Uncle Norton he doesn&#8217;t get until the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
uncle dies. Meanwhile he&#8217;s flat broke and too
proud to beg or borrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never tried trailin&#8217; a pay envelope, did
he?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;But he doesn&#8217;t know how,&#8221; says Pinckney.
&#8220;His talents don&#8217;t seem to be marketable. I
am trying to think of something he could do.
And did you know, Shorty, he&#8217;s taken quite a
fancy to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They all do,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but Marmaduke&#8217;s
easier to stand than most of &#8217;em. Next time I&#8217;m
threatened with the willies I&#8217;ll send for him and
offer to hire him by the hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I didn&#8217;t have to; for he
got into the habit of blowin&#8217; into the studio
every day or two, and swappin&#8217; a few of his
airy fancies for my mental short-arm jabs. He
said it did him good, and somehow or other it
always chirked me up too.</p>
<p>And the more I saw of Marmaduke, the less
I thought about the bats. Get under the surface,
and he wa&#8217;n&#8217;t nutty at all. He just had
a free flow of funny thoughts and odd ways of
expressin&#8217; &#8217;em. Most of us are so shy of lettin&#8217;
go of any sentiments that can&#8217;t be had on
a rubber stamp that it takes a mighty small
twist to put a person in the queer class.</p>
<p>However, business is business, and I&#8217;d just
as soon Marmaduke hadn&#8217;t been on hand the
other day when Pyramid Gordon comes in with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
one of his heavyweight broker friends. Course,
I didn&#8217;t know anything about the stranger; but
I know Pyramid, and his funnybone was fossilized
years ago. Marmaduke don&#8217;t offer to
make any break, though. He takes his fav&#8217;rite
seat over by the window and goes to gazin&#8217; out
and rubbin&#8217; his chin.</p>
<p>Seems that Mr. Gordon and his friend was
both tangled up in some bank chain snarl that
was worryin&#8217; &#8217;em a lot. Things wouldn&#8217;t be
comin&#8217; to a head for forty-eight hours or so,
and meantime all they could do was sit tight
and wait.</p>
<p>Now, Pyramid&#8217;s programme in a case of that
kind is one I made out for him myself. It&#8217;s
simple. He comes to the studio for an hour of
the roughest kind of work we can put through.
After that he goes to his Turkish bath, and by
the time his rubber is through with him he&#8217;s
ready for a private room and a ten hours&#8217;
snooze. That&#8217;s what keeps the gray out of his
cheeks, and helps him look a Grand Jury summons
in the face without goin&#8217; shaky.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s natural he recommends the same
course to this Mr. Gridley that he&#8217;s brought
along. Another thick-neck, Gridley is, with the
same flat ears as Pyramid, only he&#8217;s a little
shorter and not quite so rugged around the
chin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are, now,&#8221; says Pyramid, &#8220;and
here&#8217;s Professor McCabe, Gridley. If he can&#8217;t
make you forget your troubles, you will be the
first on record. Come on in and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Gridley he shakes his head. &#8220;Nothing
so strenuous for me,&#8221; says he. &#8220;My heart
wouldn&#8217;t stand it. I&#8217;ll wait for you, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better come in and watch, then,&#8221; says I,
with a side glance at Marmaduke.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks; I shall be quite as uncomfortable
here,&#8221; says Gridley, and camps his two
hundred and ten pounds down in my desk
chair.</p>
<p>It was a queer pair to leave together,&mdash;this
Gridley gent, who was jugglin&#8217; millions, and gettin&#8217;
all kinds of misery out of it, and Marmaduke,
calm and happy, with barely one quarter
to rub against another. But of course there
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t much chance of their findin&#8217; anything in
common to talk about.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was too busy for the next hour to
give &#8217;em a thought, and by the time I&#8217;d got
Pyramid breathin&#8217; like a leaky air valve and
glowin&#8217; like a circus poster all over, I&#8217;d clean
forgot both of &#8217;em. So, when I fin&#8217;lly strolls
out absent minded, it&#8217;s something of a shock
to find &#8217;em gettin&#8217; acquainted, Marmaduke
tiltin&#8217; back careless in his chair, and Gridley
eyin&#8217; him curious.</p>
<p>It appears that Pyramid&#8217;s friend has got restless,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
discovered Marmaduke, and proceeded to
try to tell him how near he comes to bein&#8217; a
nervous wreck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever get so you couldn&#8217;t eat, couldn&#8217;t sleep,
couldn&#8217;t think of but one thing over and over?&#8221;
he was just sayin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;To every coat of arms, the raveled sleeve
of care,&#8221; observes Marmaduke sort of casual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey?&#8221; says Gridley, facin&#8217; round on him
sharp.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the poet puts it,&#8221; Marmaduke rattles on,&mdash;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style=' font-style:italic; margin-left:4em;'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;You cannot gild the lily,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Nor can you wet the sea;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Pray tell me of my Bonnie,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>But bring her not to me!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;Say, what the howling hyenas are you
spouting about?&#8221; snorts Gridley, growin&#8217; purple
back of the ears. &#8220;Who in thunder are
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; says I, holdin&#8217; up a warnin&#8217; hand.
But I&#8217;m too late. Marmaduke has bobbed up
smilin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;A chip on the current,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I&#8217;m
Marmaduke, you know. No offense meant. And
you were saying&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunts Gridley, calmin&#8217; down.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t wet the sea, eh? Not so bad, young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
man. You can&#8217;t keep it still, either. It&#8217;s the
only thing that puts me to sleep when I get this
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Break, break, break&mdash;I know,&#8221; says Marmaduke.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; says Gridley, &#8220;hearing the surf
roar. I&#8217;d open up my seashore cottage just for
the sake of a good night&#8217;s rest, if it wasn&#8217;t for
the blasted seagulls. You&#8217;ve heard &#8217;em in winter,
haven&#8217;t you, how they squeak around?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s their wing hinges,&#8221; says Marmaduke,
solemn and serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says Gridley, gawpin&#8217; at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Squeaky wing hinges,&#8221; says Marmaduke.
&#8220;You should oil them.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, say, for a minute there, after Gridley
had got the drift of that tomfool remark, I
didn&#8217;t know whether he was goin&#8217; to throw Marmaduke
through the window, or have another
fit. All of a sudden, though, he begins poundin&#8217;
his knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;By George! but that&#8217;s rich, young man!&#8221;
says he. &#8220;Squeaky gulls&#8217; wing hinges! Haw-haw!
Oil &#8217;em! Haw-haw! How did you ever
happen to think of it, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One sweetly foolish thought,&#8221; says Marmaduke.
&#8220;I&#8217;m blessed with little else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a blessing, all right,&#8221; says Gridley.
&#8220;I have &#8217;em sometimes; but not so good
as that. Say, I&#8217;ll have to tell that to Gordon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
when he comes out. No, he wouldn&#8217;t see anything
in it. But see here, Mr. Marmaduke, what
have you got on for the evening, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My tablets are cleaner than my cuffs,&#8221; says
he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good work!&#8221; says Gridley. &#8220;What about
coming out and having dinner with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With you or any man,&#8221; says Marmaduke.
&#8220;To dine&#8217;s the thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that, off they goes, leavin&#8217; Pyramid in
the gym. doorway strugglin&#8217; with his collar.
Course, I does my best to explain what&#8217;s happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;But who was the fellow?&#8221; says Mr. Gordon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just Marmaduke,&#8221; says I, &#8220;and if you
don&#8217;t want to get your thinker tied in a double
bowknot you&#8217;ll let it go at that. He&#8217;s harmless.
First off I thought his gears didn&#8217;t mesh; but
accordin&#8217; to Pinckney he&#8217;s some kind of a
philosopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gridley has a streak of that nonsense in
him too,&#8221; says Pyramid. &#8220;I only hope he
gets it all out of his system by to-morrow
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, from all I could hear he did; for there
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any scarehead financial story in the papers,
and I guess the bank snarl must have been
straightened out all right. What puzzled me for
a few days, though, was to think what had become
of Marmaduke. He hadn&#8217;t been around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
to the studio once; and Pinckney hadn&#8217;t heard
a word from him, either. Pinckney had it all
framed up how Marmaduke was off starvin&#8217;
somewhere.</p>
<p>It was only yesterday, too, that I looks up
from the desk to see Marmaduke, all got up in
an entire new outfit, standin&#8217; there smilin&#8217; and
chipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; says I. &#8220;So you didn&#8217;t hit
the breadline, after all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perchance I deserved it,&#8221; says he; &#8220;but
there came one from the forest who willed otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, cut the josh for a minute,&#8221; says I,
&#8220;and tell us what you landed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gladly,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I have been made the
salaried secretary of the S. O. S. G. W. H.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a new benefit order,&#8221; says I, &#8220;or
what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The mystic letters,&#8221; says he, &#8220;stand for
the Society for Oiling Squeaky Gulls&#8217; Wing
Hinges. Mr. Gridley is one member; I am the
other.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, say, you may not believe it, but hanged
if it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t a fact! He has a desk in Gridley&#8217;s
private office, and once a day he shows up there
and scribbles off a foolish thought on the boss&#8217;s
calendar pad. That&#8217;s all, except that he draws
down good money for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also I have had word,&#8221; says Marmaduke,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
&#8220;that my aged Uncle Norton is very low of a
fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Some folks are born
lucky, though!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And others,&#8221; says he, &#8220;in the Forest of
Arden.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>A LOOK IN ON THE GOAT GAME</h3>
</div>

<p>Pinckney was tellin&#8217; me, here awhile back at
lunch one day, what terrors them twins of his
was gettin&#8217; to be. He relates a tragic tale about
how they&#8217;d just been requested to resign from
another private school where they&#8217;d been goin&#8217;
as day scholars.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the third this season,&#8221; says he;
&#8220;the third, mind you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s more still, ain&#8217;t there?&#8221;
says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brilliant observation, Shorty,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;also logical and pertinent. Yes, there are several
others still untried by the twins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you howlin&#8217; about, then?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; says he, toyin&#8217; with the silver
frame that holds the bill of fare, &#8220;because it is
not my intention to demoralize all the educational
institutions of this city in alphabetical
order.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;G&#8217;wan!&#8221; says I. &#8220;The kids have got to be
educated somewhere, haven&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is the sad part of it,&#8221; says Pinckney,
inspectin&#8217; the dish of scrambled eggs and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
asparagus tips and wavin&#8217; the waiter to do the
serving himself. &#8220;It means,&#8221; he goes on,
&#8220;having a governess around the house, and
you know what nuisances they can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I?&#8221; says I. &#8220;The nearest I ever got
to havin&#8217; a governess was when Mrs. O&#8217;Grady
from next door used to come in to use our wash-tubs
and I was left with her for the day. Nobody
ever called her a nuisance and got away
with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What an idyllic youth to look back upon!&#8221;
says he. &#8220;I can remember half a dozen, at
least, who had a hand in directing the course of
my budding intellect, and each one of them developed
some peculiarity which complicated the
domestic situation. I am wondering what this
new governess of ours will contribute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got one on the job already, eh?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is her third day,&#8221; says he, &#8220;and if she
manages to live through it with the twins, I
shall have hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, pickles!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Those kids are all
right. They&#8217;re full of life and ginger, that&#8217;s
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially ginger,&#8221; says Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;What of it?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Or are you just
blowin&#8217; about &#8217;em? It&#8217;s all right, they&#8217;re a
great pair, and any time you want to entertain
me for half an hour, turn &#8217;em loose in my
comp&#8217;ny.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Done!&#8221; says Pinckney. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take a cab
right up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it off three minutes, can&#8217;t you?&#8221; says
I, lookin&#8217; over the French pastry tray and
spearin&#8217; a frosted creampuff that was decorated
up with sugar flowers until it looked like a
bride&#8217;s bouquet.</p>
<p>He insists on callin&#8217; my bluff, though; so up
the avenue we goes, when I should have been
hotfootin&#8217; it back to the studio. But I could see
that Pinckney was some anxious about how the
kids was gettin&#8217; on, Gertie being away for the
day, and I thinks maybe I&#8217;ll be useful in calmin&#8217;
any riot he might find in progress.</p>
<p>All was quiet and peaceful, though, as Pinckney
opens the door with his latchkey. No howls
from upstairs, no front windows broken, and nobody
slidin&#8217; down the banisters. We was just
waitin&#8217; for the automatic elevator to come down
when we hears voices floatin&#8217; out from the lib&#8217;ry.
Pinckney steps to the doorway where he can see
through into the next room, and then beckons
me up for a squint.</p>
<p>It wa&#8217;n&#8217;t the kids at all, but a couple of grownups
that was both strangers to me. From the
way the young woman is dressed I could guess
she was the new governess. Anyway, she&#8217;s
makin&#8217; herself right to home, so far as entertainin&#8217;
comp&#8217;ny goes; for she and the gent with
her is more or less close together and mixed up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
First off it looked like a side-hold lover&#8217;s clinch,
and then again it didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a huggin&#8217; match, or a rough-house
tackle?&#8221; I whispered over Pinckney&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I pass the declaration,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Suppose
we investigate.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that we strolls in, and we&#8217;re within a
dozen feet of the couple before they get wise
to the fact that there&#8217;s an int&#8217;rested audience.
I must say, though, that they made a clean,
quick breakaway. Then they stands, starin&#8217;
at us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Miss Marston!&#8221; says Pinckney. &#8220;Do
I interrupt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;you see, sir,&#8221; she begins, &#8220;I&mdash;that
is&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>And she breaks down with as bad a case of
rattles as I ever see. She&#8217;s a nice lookin&#8217;, modest
appearin&#8217; young woman, too, a little soft
about the mouth, but more or less classy in her
lines. Her hair is some mussed, and there&#8217;s
sort of a wild, desp&#8217;rate look in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;A near relative, I presume?&#8221; suggests
Pinckney, noddin&#8217; at the gent, who&#8217;s takin&#8217; it
all cool enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, sir,&#8221; gasps out the governess.
&#8220;My husband, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the gent, he bows as easy and natural
as if he was bein&#8217; introduced at an afternoon
tea party. &#8220;Glad to know you,&#8221; says he,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
stickin&#8217; out his hand, which Pinckney, bein&#8217; absent-minded
just then, fails to see.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221; says Pinckney, lookin&#8217; the governess
up and down. &#8220;Then it&#8217;s not Miss Marston,
but Mrs.&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; says she, lettin&#8217; her chin drop, &#8220;Mrs.
Marston.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very unfortunate,&#8221; says Pinckney,
&#8220;very!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haw, haw, haw!&#8221; breaks out the strange
gent, slappin&#8217; his knee. &#8220;I say now, but that&#8217;s
a good one, that is, even if it is at my expense!
Unfortunate, eh? Perfectly true though, perfectly
true!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now it takes a lot to get Pinckney going; but
for a minute all he does is turn and size up this
husband party with the keen sense of humor. I
had my mouth open and my eyes bugged too;
for he don&#8217;t look the part at all. Why, he&#8217;s
dressed neat and expensive, a little sporty
maybe, for a real gent; but he carries it off
well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to have your assurance that I was
right,&#8221; says Pinckney, still givin&#8217; him the frosty
eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t mention it,&#8221; says Mr. Marston.
&#8220;And I trust you will overlook my butting in
here to see Kitty&mdash;er, Mrs. Marston. Little
matter of sentiment and&mdash;well, business, you
know. I don&#8217;t think it will happen often.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am quite sure it won&#8217;t,&#8221; says Pinckney.
&#8220;And now, if the interview has been finished,
I would suggest that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly, certainly!&#8221; says Marston,
edging towards the door. &#8220;Allow me, gentlemen,
to bid you good-day. And I say, Kit, don&#8217;t
forget that little matter. By-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>Honest, if I could make as slick a backout as
that, without carryin&#8217; away anybody&#8217;s footprint,
I&#8217;d rate myself a headliner among the
trouble dodgers. Pinckney, though, don&#8217;t seem
to appreciate such talents.</p>
<p>&#8220;That settles governess No. 1,&#8221; says he as
we starts for the elevator again. &#8220;We are beginning
the series well.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was before he saw how smooth she got
along with Jack and Jill. After she&#8217;d given
an exhibition of kid trainin&#8217; that was a wonder,
he remarked that possibly he might as well let
her stay the week out.</p>
<p>&#8220;But of course,&#8221; says he, &#8220;she will have
to go. Hanged if I understand how Mrs. Purdy-Pell
happened to send her here, either! Shorty,
do you suppose Sadie could throw any light
on this case?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call for a report,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>Does Sadie know anything about the Marstons?
Well, rather! Says she told me all about
&#8217;em at the time too; but if she did it must have
got by. Anyway, this was just a plain, simple
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
case of a worthless son marryin&#8217; the fam&#8217;ly governess
and bein&#8217; thrown out for it by a stern
parent, same as they always are in them English
novels Sadie&#8217;s forever readin&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Marstons was Madison-ave. folks, which
means that their back yard was bounded on the
west by the smart set&mdash;and that&#8217;s as far as
there&#8217;s any need of going. The girl comes from
&#8217;Frisco and is an earthquake orphan. Hence
the governess stunt. As for young Marston,
he&#8217;d been chucked out of college, tried out for
a failure in the old man&#8217;s brokerage office, and
then left to drift around town on a skimpy allowance.
So he was in fine shape to get married!
The girl sticks to him, though, until
there&#8217;s trouble with the landlady, and then,
when he only turns ugly and makes no move towards
gettin&#8217; a job, she calls it off, gives him
the slip, and begins rustlin&#8217; for herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; says Pinckney, &#8220;I suppose she
ought to have a chance. But if that husband of
hers is going to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time you catch him at it,&#8221; says I,
&#8220;just &#8217;phone down for me. It&#8217;ll be a pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>I meant it too; for after hearing how she&#8217;d
lost other places on account of his hangin&#8217;
around I could have enjoyed mussin&#8217; him up
some.</p>
<p>With my feelin&#8217; that way, you can guess what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
a jar it is, one afternoon when I&#8217;m having a
little front office chat with my old reg&#8217;lar, Pyramid
Gordon, to see this same gent blow in
through the door. Almost looked like he knew
what he ought to get and had come after it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; says I as chilly as I knew how.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; says he, &#8220;quite so. I see you
remember our recent meeting. Awkward situation
for a moment, wasn&#8217;t it, eh? Splendid chap,
though, your friend&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, choke off the hot air,&#8221; says I, &#8220;and
let&#8217;s hear what gave you the courage to climb
those stairs!&#8221;</p>
<p>And what do you guess? He takes five minutes
of steady chinnin&#8217; to get around to it; but
he puts over such a velvety line of talk, and it&#8217;s
so int&#8217;restin&#8217; to watch him do it, that I let him
spiel ahead until he gets to the enactin&#8217; clause
in his own way. And it&#8217;s nothing more or less
than a brassy fingered touch for a twenty, all
based on the fact that he met me at a house
where his wife&#8217;s drawin&#8217; wages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gordon,&#8221; says I, turnin&#8217; to Pyramid,
who&#8217;s heard it all, &#8220;what do you think of that,
anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very neat, indeed,&#8221; says Pyramid, chucklin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then a few!&#8221; says I. &#8220;I can almost
see myself givin&#8217; up that twenty right off the
bat. Nothing but great presence of mind and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
wonderful self-control holds me back. But look
here, Mr. What&#8217;s-your-name&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marston,&#8221; says he, flashin&#8217; an engraved visitin&#8217;
card, &#8220;L. Egbert Marston.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;L. Egbert, eh?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Does the L stand
for Limed? And what do they call you for
short&mdash;Eggie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, suit yourself,&#8221; says he, with a careless
wave of the hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Eggie,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but before we
get in any deeper I&#8217;ve got a conundrum or two
to spring on you. We got kind of curious,
Pinckney and me, about that visit of yours. He
thinks we disturbed a fond embrace. It looked
diff&#8217;rent to me. I thought I could see finger-marks
on the young lady&#8217;s throat. How about
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Course he flushes up. Any man would under
a jab like that, and I looked for him either to
begin breakin&#8217; the peace or start lyin&#8217; out of
it. There&#8217;s considerable beef to Egbert, you
know. He&#8217;d probably weigh in at a hundred and
eighty, with all that flabby meat on him, and if
it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t for that sort of cheap look to his face
you might take him for a real man. But he
don&#8217;t show any more fight than a cow. He don&#8217;t
even put in any indignant &#8220;Not guilty!&#8221; He
just shrugs his shoulders and indulges in a
sickly laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t sound nice,&#8221; says he; &#8220;but sometimes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
they do need a bit of training, these
women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For instance?&#8221; says I. &#8220;In the matter of
handing over a little spendin&#8217; money, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve struck it,&#8221; says he, with another
shrug.</p>
<p>I glances at Pyramid; but there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any
more expression to that draw poker face of his
than as if it was a cement block.</p>
<p>&#8220;Egbert,&#8221; says I, frank and confidential,
&#8220;you&#8217;re a sweet scented pill, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>And does that draw any assault and battery
motions? It don&#8217;t. All the result is to narrow
them shifty eyes of his and steady &#8217;em down
until he&#8217;s lookin&#8217; me square in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was hard up, if you want to know,&#8221; says
he. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have a dollar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that,&#8221; says I, &#8220;is what you give out
as an excuse for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he breaks in. &#8220;And I&#8217;m no worse
than lots of other men, either. With money,
I&#8217;m a gentleman; without it&mdash;well, I get it any
way I can. And I want to tell you, I&#8217;ve seen
men with plenty of it get more in meaner ways.
I don&#8217;t know how to juggle stocks, or wreck
banks, or use any of the respectable methods
that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing personal, I hope,&#8221; puts in Mr. Gordon,
with another chuckle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so intended,&#8221; says Marston.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, thanks,&#8221; says Pyramid.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll admit,&#8221; says I, &#8220;that your partic&#8217;lar
way of raisin&#8217; funds, Mr. Marston, ain&#8217;t exactly
novel; but didn&#8217;t it ever occur to you that some
folks get theirs by workin&#8217; for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; says he, tryin&#8217; to seem good natured
again; &#8220;but I&#8217;m not that kind. I&#8217;m an
idler. As some poet has put it, &#8216;Useless I linger,
a cumberer here.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a cucumber, all right,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but
why not, just for a change, make a stab at gettin&#8217;
a job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had several,&#8221; says he, &#8220;and never
could hold one more than a week. Too monotonous,
for one thing; and then, in these offices,
one is thrown among so many ill bred persons,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; says I, feelin&#8217; my temper&#8217;ture
risin&#8217;. &#8220;Parties that had rather work for a
pay envelope than choke their wives. I&#8217;ve met
&#8217;em. I&#8217;ve heard of your kind too, Egbert; but
you&#8217;re the first specimen I ever got real close
to. And you&#8217;re a bird! Mr. Gordon, shall I
chuck him through the window, or help him
downstairs with my toe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t do either,&#8221; says Pyramid. &#8220;In
fact, I think I can make use of this young man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re welcome to him,&#8221; says I.
&#8220;Blaze ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much obliged,&#8221; says Pyramid. &#8220;Now, Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
Marston, what is the most reasonable sum, per
month, that would allow you to carry out your
idea of being a gentleman?&#8221;</p>
<p>Egbert thinks that over a minute and then
puts it at three hundred.</p>
<p>&#8220;And would it conflict with those ideas,&#8221;
Pyramid goes on, &#8220;if you were required, say
twice a week, to spend an hour in a private office,
signing your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>Egbert thinks he could stand that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; says Pyramid, producin&#8217;
his checkbook and gettin&#8217; busy with the fountain
pen, &#8220;here is your first month&#8217;s salary in advance.
Whenever you find it convenient during
the week, report at my offices. Ask for Mr.
Bradley. Yes, Bradley. That&#8217;s all,&#8221; and Pyramid
lights up one of his torches as satisfied as
though he&#8217;d just bought in a Senator.</p>
<p>As for Egbert, he stows the check away, taps
me on the shoulder, and remarks real friendly,
&#8220;Well, professor, no hard feelings, I hope?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Eggie,&#8221; says I, &#8220;seems to me I expressed
myself once on that point, and I ain&#8217;t
had any sudden change of heart. If I was you
I&#8217;d beat while the beatin&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Egbert laughs; but he takes the advice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; says I to Pyramid. &#8220;I expect
that&#8217;s your notion of making a funny play,
eh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no humorist, Shorty,&#8221; says he.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then what&#8217;s the idea?&#8221; says I. &#8220;What do
you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never mean anything but cold, straight
business,&#8221; says he. &#8220;That&#8217;s the only game
worth playing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Then here&#8217;s where you got
let in bad with your eyes open. You heard him
tell how useless he was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; says Pyramid; &#8220;but I always do
my own appraising when I hire men. I anticipate
finding Mr. Marston somewhat useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>And say, that&#8217;s all I can get out of Pyramid
on the subject; for when it comes to business,
he&#8217;s about as chatty over his plans as a hard
shell clam on the suffragette question. I&#8217;ve
known him to make some freak plans; but this
move of pickin&#8217; out a yellow one like Egbert
and rewardin&#8217; him as if he was a Carnegie
medal winner beat anything he&#8217;d ever sprung
yet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no bluff, either. I hears of this Marston
gent sportin&#8217; around at the clubs, and it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
until I accident&#8217;lly run across an item on the
Wall Street page that I gets any more details.
He shows up, if you please, as secretary of the
Consolidated Holding Company that there&#8217;s
been so much talk about. I asks Pinckney what
kind of an outfit that was; but he don&#8217;t
know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; says I. &#8220;All I&#8217;d feel safe in givin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
Egbert to hold for me would be one end of the
Brooklyn Bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what he holds,&#8221; says Pinckney,
&#8220;if he will stay away from our little governess.
She&#8217;s a treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seems Mrs. Marston had been doin&#8217; some
great tricks with the twins, not only keepin&#8217;
&#8217;em from marrin&#8217; the furniture, but teachin&#8217; &#8217;em
all kinds of knowledge and improvin&#8217; their table
manners, until it was almost safe to have &#8217;em
down to luncheon now and then.</p>
<p>But her life was being made miser&#8217;ble by the
prospect of havin&#8217; Egbert show up any day and
create a row. She confided the whole tale to
Sadie, how she was through with Marston for
good, but didn&#8217;t dare tell him so, and how she
sent him most of her salary to keep him
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;The loafer!&#8221; says I. &#8220;And think of the
chance I had at him there in the studio!
Hanged if I don&#8217;t get even with Pyramid for
that, though!&#8221;</p>
<p>But I didn&#8217;t. Mr. Gordon&#8217;s been too busy
this season to show up for any trainin&#8217;, and
it was only here the other day that I runs across
him in the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says I, &#8220;how&#8217;s that work scornin&#8217;
pet of yours gettin&#8217; on these days?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marston?&#8221; says he. &#8220;Why, haven&#8217;t you
heard? Mr. Marston is away on a vacation.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Vacation!&#8221; says I. &#8220;He needs it, he
does!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The company thought so,&#8221; says Pyramid.
&#8220;They gave him six months&#8217; leave with pay.
He&#8217;s hunting reindeer or musk ox somewhere up
in British Columbia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Him a hunter?&#8221; says I. &#8220;G&#8217;wan!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pyramid grins. &#8220;He did develop a liking for
the wilderness rather suddenly,&#8221; says he; &#8220;but
that is where he is now. In fact, I shouldn&#8217;t be
surprised if he stayed up there for a year or
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the joke?&#8221; says I, catchin&#8217; a flicker
in them puffy eyes of Pyramid&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, just this,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Mr. Marston,
you know, is secretary of the Consolidated Holding
Company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I read about that,&#8221; says I. &#8220;What
then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It pains me to state,&#8221; says Mr. Gordon,
&#8220;that in his capacity of secretary Mr. Marston
seems to have sanctioned transactions which
violate the Interstate Commerce act.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah-ha!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Turned crooked on you,
did he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not sure as yet,&#8221; says Pyramid.
&#8220;The federal authorities are anxious to settle
that point by examining certain files which appear
to be missing. They even asked me about
them. Perhaps you didn&#8217;t notice, Shorty, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
I was cross-examined for five hours, one day last
week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t read them muck rakin&#8217; articles,&#8221;
says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; says Pyramid. &#8220;Well, I
couldn&#8217;t explain; for, as their own enterprising
detectives discovered, when Mr. Marston
boarded the Montreal Express his baggage included
a trunk and two large cases. Odd of
him to take shipping files on a hunting trip,
wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; and Pyramid tips me the slow
wink.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m more or less of a thickhead when it
comes to flossy finance; but I&#8217;ve seen enough
plain flimflam games to know a few things. And
the wink clinched it. &#8220;Mr. Gordon,&#8221; says I,
&#8220;for a Mr. Smooth you&#8217;ve got a greased pig in
the warthog class. But suppose Egbert gets
sick of the woods and hikes himself back? What
then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jail,&#8221; says Pyramid, shruggin&#8217; his sable
collar up around his ears. &#8220;That would be
rather deplorable too. Bright young man,
Marston, in many ways, and peculiarly adapted
for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know the part,&#8221; says I. &#8220;They
gen&#8217;rally spells it g-o-a-t.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>MRS. TRUCKLES&#8217; BROAD JUMP</h3>
</div>

<p>And do you imagine Kitty Marston settles
down to a life job after that? Not her. At
the very next pay day she hands in her two
weeks&#8217; notice, and when they pin her right down
to facts she admits weepy that she means to
start out lookin&#8217; for Egbert. Now wouldn&#8217;t
that crust you?</p>
<p>Course, the sequel to that is another governess
hunt which winds up with Madame Roulaire.
And say, talk about your queer cases&mdash;&mdash;But
you might as well have the details.</p>
<p>You see, until Aunt Martha arrived on the
scene this Madame Roulaire business was only
a fam&#8217;ly joke over to Pinckney&#8217;s, with all of us
in on it more or less. But Aunt Martha ain&#8217;t
been there more&#8217;n three or four days before
she&#8217;s dug up mystery and scandal and tragedy
enough for another one of them French dope
dramas.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my opinion,&#8221; says she, &#8220;that woman is
hiding some dreadful secret!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Pinckney only smiles in that calm,
placid way of hers. You know how easy she took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
things when she was Miss Geraldine and Pinckney
found her on the steamer in charge of the
twins that had been willed to him? Well, she
ain&#8217;t changed a bit; and, with Pinckney such
a brilliant member of the Don&#8217;t Worry Fraternity,
whatever frettin&#8217; goes on in that house
has to be done by volunteers.</p>
<p>Aunt Martha acts like she was wise to this;
for she starts right in to make up for lost opportunities,
and when she spots this freaky
lookin&#8217; governess she immediately begins
scoutin&#8217; for trouble. Suspicions? She delivers
a fresh lot after every meal!</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; says she. &#8220;Madame Roulaire,
indeed! Well, I must say, she looks as little
like a Frenchwoman as any person I ever saw!
How long have you had her, Geraldine? What,
only two months? Did she bring written references,
and did you investigate them carefully?&#8221;</p>
<p>She wouldn&#8217;t let up, either, until she&#8217;d been
assured that Madame Roulaire had come from
service in an English fam&#8217;ly, and that they&#8217;d
written on crested notepaper indorsin&#8217; her in
every point, giving her whole hist&#8217;ry from childhood
up.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she hasn&#8217;t the slightest French accent,&#8221;
insists Aunt Martha.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; says Mrs. Pinckney. &#8220;She lived
in England from the time she was sixteen, and
of course twenty years away from one&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Does she claim to be only thirty-six?&#8221; exclaims
Aunt Martha. &#8220;Why, she&#8217;s fifty if she&#8217;s
a day! Besides, I don&#8217;t like that snaky way
she has of watching everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no denyin&#8217;, either, that this Roulaire
party did have a pair of shifty eyes in
her head. I&#8217;d noticed that much myself in the
few times I&#8217;d seen her. They wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any particular
color you could name,&mdash;sort of a greeny
gray-blue,&mdash;but they sure was bright and restless.
You&#8217;d never hear a sound out of her, for
she didn&#8217;t let go of any remarks that wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
dragged from her; but somehow you felt, from
the minute you got into the room until she&#8217;d
made a gumshoe exit by the nearest door, that
them sleuthy lamps never quite lost sight of you.</p>
<p>That and her smile was the main points about
her. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of diff&#8217;rent kinds of smiles,
meanin&#8217; and unmeanin&#8217;; but this chronic half-smirk
of Madame Roulaire&#8217;s was about the most
unconvincin&#8217; performance I&#8217;ve ever watched.
Why, even a blind man could tell she didn&#8217;t
really mean it! Outside of that, she was just
a plain, pie faced sort of female with shrinkin&#8217;,
apologizin&#8217; ways and a set of store teeth that
didn&#8217;t fit any too well; but she wa&#8217;n&#8217;t one that
you&#8217;d suspect of anything more tragic than
eatin&#8217; maraschino cherries on the sly, or swappin&#8217;
household gossip with the cook.</p>
<p>That wa&#8217;n&#8217;t the way Martha had her sized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
up, though, and of course there was no keepin&#8217;
her inquisitive nose out of the case. First thing
anyone knew, she&#8217;d backed Madame Roulaire
into a corner, put her through the third degree,
and come trottin&#8217; back in triumph to Mrs.
Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you?&#8221; says she. &#8220;French!
Bosh! Perhaps you haven&#8217;t asked her about
Auberge-sur-Mer, where she says she was
born?&#8221;</p>
<p>Greraldine admits that she ain&#8217;t done much
pumpin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have,&#8221; says Aunt Martha, &#8220;and
she couldn&#8217;t tell me a thing about the place that
was so. I spent ten days there only two years
ago, and remember it perfectly. She isn&#8217;t any
more French than I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what of it?&#8221; says Mrs. Pinckney.
&#8220;She gets along splendidly with the twins.
They think the world of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s thoroughly deceitful,&#8221; Aunt
Martha comes back. &#8220;She misrepresents her
age, lies about her birthplace, and&mdash;and she
wears a transformation wig.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I had noticed the brown wig,&#8221; admits
Mrs. Pinckney; &#8220;but they&#8217;re quite common.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So are women poisoners,&#8221; snaps Martha.
&#8220;Think of what happened to the Briggses, after
they took in that strange maid! Then there
was the Madame Catossi case, over in Florence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
last year. They were warned about her,
you remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>And maybe you know how a good lively suspecter
can get results when she keeps followin&#8217;
it up. They got to watchin&#8217; the governess close
when she was around, and noticin&#8217; all the little
slips in her talk and the crab-like motions
she made in dodgin&#8217; strangers. That appears
to make her worse than ever, too. She&#8217;d get
fussed every time anyone looked her way, and
just some little question about the children
would make her jump and color up like she&#8217;d
been accused of burnin&#8217; a barn. Even Sadie,
who&#8217;d been standin&#8217; up for her right along,
begins to weaken.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; says she, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure there
isn&#8217;t something queer about that woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, all governesses are queer, ain&#8217;t they?&#8221;
says I; &#8220;but that ain&#8217;t any sign they&#8217;ve done
time or are in the habit of dosin&#8217; the coffeepot
with arsenic. It&#8217;s Aunt Martha has stirred
all this mess up, and she&#8217;d make the angel
Gabriel prove who he was by blowin&#8217; bugle
calls.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was only next day, though, that we gets a
report of what happens when Pinckney runs
across this Sir Carpenter-Podmore at the club
and lugs him out to dinner. He&#8217;s an English
gent Pinckney had known abroad. Comin&#8217; in
unexpected that way, him and Madame Roulaire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
had met face to face in the hall, while the introductions
was bein&#8217; passed out&mdash;and what
does she do but turn putty colored and shake
like she was havin&#8217; a fit!</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Truckles?&#8221; says Podmore, sort of cordial.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she gasps. &#8220;Roulaire! I am
Madame Roulaire!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; says Sir Carpenter,
liftin&#8217; his eyebrows and passin&#8217; on.</p>
<p>That was all there was to it; but everyone
in the house heard about it. Course Aunt
Martha jumps right in with the question marks;
but all she gets out of Podmore is that he presumes
he was mistaken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe he was,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Why
not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you haven&#8217;t heard,&#8221; says Sadie,
&#8220;that Sir Carpenter was for a long time a
Judge on the criminal bench.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Z-z-z-zing!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Looks kind of
squally for the governess, don&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>If it hadn&#8217;t been for Pinckney, too, Aunt
Martha&#8217;d had her thrown out that night; but
he wouldn&#8217;t have it that way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been murdered in my bed, or
been fed on ground glass,&#8221; says he, &#8220;and&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;I might like the sensation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Say, there&#8217;s more sides to that Pinckney than
there are to a cutglass paperweight. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
might think, with him such a Reggie chap, that
havin&#8217; a suspicious character like that around
would get on his nerves; but, when it comes to
applyin&#8217; the real color test, there ain&#8217;t any
more yellow in him than in a ball of bluin&#8217;, and
he can be as curious about certain things as a
kid investigatin&#8217; the animal cages.</p>
<p>Rather than tie the can to Madame Roulaire
without gettin&#8217; a straight line on her, he was
willin&#8217; to run chances. And it don&#8217;t make any
difference to him how much Aunt Martha croaks
about this and that, and suggests how dreadful
it is to think of those dear, innocent little children
exposed to such evil influences. That last
item appeals strong to Mrs. Pinckney and Sadie,
though.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; says Geraldine, &#8220;the twins
don&#8217;t suspect a thing as yet, and whatever we
discover must be kept from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; says Sadie, &#8220;the poor little
dears mustn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>So part of the programme was to keep them
out of her way as much as possible without
actually callin&#8217; her to the bench, and that&#8217;s what
fetched me out there early the other afternoon.
It was my turn at protectin&#8217; innocent childhood.
I must say, though, it&#8217;s hard realizin&#8217; they need
anything of that sort when you&#8217;re within reach
of that Jack and Jill combination. Most people
seem to feel the other way; but, while their society
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
is apt to be more or less strenuous, I can
gen&#8217;rally stand an hour or so of it without
collectin&#8217; any broken bones.</p>
<p>As usual, they receives me with an ear splittin&#8217;
whoop, and while Jill gives me the low
tackle around the knees Jack proceeds to climb
up my back and twine his arms affectionate
around my neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Uncle Shorty,&#8221; they yells in chorus,
&#8220;come play Wild West with us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;G&#8217;wan, you young terrors!&#8221; says I, luggin&#8217;
&#8217;em out on the lawn and dumpin&#8217; &#8217;em on the
grass. &#8220;Think I&#8217;d risk my neck at any such
game as that? Hi! leggo that necktie or I&#8217;ll
put on the spanks! Say, ain&#8217;t you got any
respect for company clothes? Now straighten
up quiet and tell me about the latest deviltry
you&#8217;ve been up to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; says Jill. &#8220;We&#8217;re not afraid of
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we know why you&#8217;re here to-day, too,&#8221;
says Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s have
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on guard,&#8221; says Jill, &#8220;keeping us
away from old Clicky.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Clicky?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh-huh,&#8221; says Jack. &#8220;The goosy governess,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I, openin&#8217; my eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We call her that,&#8221; says Jill, &#8220;because her
teeth click so when she gets excited. At night
she keeps &#8217;em in a glass of water. Do you suppose
they click then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her hair comes off too,&#8221; says Jack, &#8220;and
it&#8217;s all gray underneath. We fished it off once,
and she was awful mad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You just ought to hear her when she gets
mad,&#8221; says Jill. &#8220;She drops her H&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She don&#8217;t do it before folks, though,&#8221; says
Jack, &#8220;&#8217;cause she makes believe she&#8217;s French.
She&#8217;s awful good to us, though, and we love
her just heaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got queer ways of showin&#8217; it,&#8221;
says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes Aunt Martha so scared of
her?&#8221; says Jill. &#8220;Do you think it&#8217;s so she
would really and truly murder us all and run
off with the jewelry, or that she&#8217;d let in burglars
after dark? She meets someone every Thursday
night by the side gate, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A tall woman with veils over her face,&#8221;
adds Jack. &#8220;We hid in the bushes and watched
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, for the love of Mike,&#8221; says I, &#8220;is
there anything about your governess you kids
haven&#8217;t heard or seen? What more do you
know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots,&#8221; says Jill. &#8220;She&#8217;s scared of Marie,
the new maid. Marie makes her help with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
dishes, and make up her own bed, and wait on
herself all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she has to study beforehand all the
lessons she makes us learn,&#8221; says Jack. &#8220;She
studies like fun every night in her room, and
when we ask questions from the back of the
book she don&#8217;t know the answers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been too scared to study or anything,
ever since Monday,&#8221; says Jill. &#8220;Do you think
they&#8217;ll have a policeman take her away before
she poisons us all? We heard Aunt Martha
say they ought to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Say, they had the whole story, and more too.
If there was anything about Madame Roulaire&#8217;s
actions, her past hist&#8217;ry, or what people thought
of her that had got by these two, I&#8217;d like to
know what it was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Talk about protectin&#8217;
you! What you need most is a pair of gags
and some blinders. Now trot along off and do
your worst, while I look up Pinckney and give
him some advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was strollin&#8217; through the house lookin&#8217; for
him, and I&#8217;d got as far as the lib&#8217;ry, when who
should I see but Madame Roulaire comin&#8217;
through the opposite door. Someway, I didn&#8217;t
feel like meetin&#8217; them sleuthy eyes just then, or
seein&#8217; that smirky smile; so I dodges back and
pikes down the hall. She must have had the
same thought; for we almost collides head on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
halfway down, and the next thing I know she&#8217;s
dropped onto a davenport, sobbin&#8217; and shakin&#8217;
all over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me for mentionin&#8217; it,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but
there ain&#8217;t any call for hysterics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know who you are now,&#8221; says she.
&#8220;You&mdash;you&#8217;re a private detective!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I. &#8220;How&#8217;d you get onto my
disguise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it from the first,&#8221; says she. &#8220;And
then, when I saw you with the children, asking
them about me&mdash;&mdash;Oh, you won&#8217;t arrest me
and take me away from the darlings, will you?
Please don&#8217;t take me to jail! I&#8217;ll tell you everything,
truly I will, sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That might help some,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but, if
you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to &#8217;fess up, suppose you begin at
Chapter I. Was it the fam&#8217;ly jewels you was
after?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; says she. &#8220;I never took a penny&#8217;s
worth in my life. Truckles could tell you
that if he could only be here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Truckles, eh!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Now just who
was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My &#8217;usband, sir,&#8221; says she. &#8220;And I&#8217;m Mrs.
Truckles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh-ho!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Then this Roulaire
name you&#8217;ve been flaggin&#8217; under was sort of
a <i>nom de plume</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was for Katy I did it!&#8221; she sobs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Well, what about
Katy?&#8221;</p>
<p>And, say, that was the way it come out; first,
a bit here and then a bit there, with me puttin&#8217;
the ends together and patchin&#8217; this soggy everyday
yarn out of what we&#8217;d all thought was such
a deep, dark mystery.</p>
<p>She was English, Mrs. Truckles was, and so
was the late Truckles. They&#8217;d worked together,
him bein&#8217; a first class butler whose only fault
was he couldn&#8217;t keep his fingers off the decanters.
It was after he&#8217;d struck the bottom of
the toboggan slide and that thirst of his had
finished him for good and all that Mrs. Truckles
collects her little Katy from where they&#8217;d
boarded her out and comes across to try her
luck on this side.</p>
<p>She&#8217;d worked up as far as housekeeper, and
had made enough to educate Katy real well and
marry her off to a bright young gent by the
name of McGowan that owned a half interest
in a corner saloon up in the Bronx and stood
well with the district leader.</p>
<p>She was happy and contented in them days,
Mrs. Truckles was, with McGowan doin&#8217; a
rushin&#8217; business, gettin&#8217; his name on the Tammany
ticket, and Katy patronizing a swell
dressmaker and havin&#8217; a maid of her own.
Then, all of a sudden, Mrs. Truckles tumbles
to the fact that Katy is gettin&#8217; ashamed of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
havin&#8217; a mother that&#8217;s out to service and eatin&#8217;
with the chauffeur and the cook. Not that she
wants her livin&#8217; with them,&mdash;McGowan wouldn&#8217;t
stand for that,&mdash;but Katy did think Mother
might do something for a living that wouldn&#8217;t
blur up the fam&#8217;ly escutcheon quite so much.</p>
<p>It was just when Mrs. Truckles was feelin&#8217;
this most keen that the French governess where
she was got married and went West to live,
leavin&#8217; behind her, besides a collection of old
hats, worn out shoes, and faded picture postals,
this swell reference from Lady Jigwater. And
havin&#8217; put in a year or so in France with dif&#8217;rent
families that had taken her across, and
havin&#8217; had to pick up more or less of the language,
Mrs. Truckles conceives the great scheme
of promotin&#8217; herself from the back to the front
of the house. So she chucks up as workin&#8217;
housekeeper, splurges on the wig, and strikes
a swell intelligence office with this phony reference.</p>
<p>Course, with anybody else but an easy mark
like Mrs. Pinckney, maybe she wouldn&#8217;t have
got away with it; but all Geraldine does is
glance at the paper, ask her if she likes children,
and put her on the payroll.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; says I. &#8220;And it got you some worried
tryin&#8217; to make good, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was near crazy over it,&#8221; says she. &#8220;I
thought I could do it at first; but it came cruel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
&#8217;ard. Oh, sir, the lies I&#8217;ve &#8217;ad to tell, keepin&#8217;
it up. And with the rest of the &#8217;elp all &#8217;ating
me! Marie used me worst of all, though. She
made me tell &#8217;er everything, and &#8217;eld it over my
&#8217;ead. Next that Aunt Martha came and thought
up so many bad things about me&mdash;you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but how about this Sir
Podmore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was &#8217;ead laundress at Podmore &#8217;Ouse,&#8221;
says she, &#8220;and I thought it was all up when he
saw me here. I never should have tried to do
it. I&#8217;m a good &#8217;ousekeeper, if I do say it; but
I&#8217;m getting to be an old woman now, and this
will end me. It was for Katy I did it, though.
Every week she used to come and throw it in
my face that she couldn&#8217;t call at the front door
and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;Well, I &#8217;opes you&#8217;ll believe me,
sir; but that was just the way of it, and if I&#8217;m
taken to jail it will kill Katy and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; breaks in a voice behind us. &#8220;Here,
Pinckney! Come, Geraldine! This way everybody!&#8221;
and as I turns around there&#8217;s Aunt
Martha with the accusin&#8217; finger out and her
face fairly beamin&#8217;. Before I can get in a word
she&#8217;s assembled the fam&#8217;ly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I tell you?&#8221; she cackles. &#8220;She&#8217;s
broken down and confessed! I heard her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it true, Shorty?&#8221; demands Mrs. Pinckney.
&#8220;Does she admit that she was plotting
to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yep!&#8221; says I. &#8220;It&#8217;s something awful too,
almost enough to curdle your blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; says Aunt Martha. &#8220;Tell us the
worst. What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a case of standin&#8217; broad jump,&#8221; says
I, &#8220;from housekeeper to governess, with an
age handicap and a crooked entry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Course, I has to work out the details for &#8217;em,
and when I&#8217;ve stated the whole hideous plot,
from the passing of Truckles the Thirsty to the
high pride of Katy the Barkeep&#8217;s Bride, includin&#8217;
the tale of the stolen character and
chuckin&#8217; the nervy bluff&mdash;well, they didn&#8217;t any
of &#8217;em know what to say. They just stands
around gawpin&#8217; curious at this sobbin&#8217;, wabbly
kneed old party slumped down there on the hall
seat.</p>
<p>Aunt Martha, actin&#8217; as prosecutor for the
State, is the first to recover. &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no
knowin&#8217; how far she might have gone,&#8221; says
she. &#8220;And she ought to be punished some
way. Pinckney, what are you going to do with
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a minute he looks from Aunt Martha to
the object in the middle of the circle, and then
he drops them black eyelashes lazy, like he was
half-asleep, and I knew somethin&#8217; was coming
worth listenin&#8217; to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Considering all the circumstances,&#8221; says
Pinckney, &#8220;I think we shall discharge Marie,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
increase Mrs. Truckles&#8217; salary, give her an assistant,
and ask her to stay with us permanently.
Eh, Geraldine?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Geraldine nods hearty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pinckney, let&#8217;s shake on that,&#8221; says I.
&#8220;Even if your head is full of soap bubbles,
you&#8217;ve got an eighteen-carat heart in you.
Hear the news, Mrs. Truckles?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;then I&#8217;m not to go to jail?&#8221; says
she, takin&#8217; her hands off her face and lookin&#8217;
up straight and steady for the first time in
months.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jail nothin&#8217;!&#8221; says I. &#8220;There&#8217;s goin&#8217; to
be a new deal, and you start in fresh with a
clean slate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; snorts Aunt Martha. &#8220;Do you
expect me to stay here and countenance any such
folly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m far too considerate of my relatives for
that,&#8221; says Pinckney. &#8220;There&#8217;s a train at five-thirty-six.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, say, to see Mrs. Truckles now, with her
gray hair showin&#8217; natural, and her chin up, and
a twin hangin&#8217; to either hand, and the sleuthy
look gone out of them old eyes, you&#8217;d hardly
know her for the same party!</p>
<p>These antelope leaps is all right sometimes;
but when you take &#8217;em you want to be wearin&#8217;
your own shoes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>HEINEY TAKES THE GLOOM CURE</h3>
</div>

<p>Two in one day, mind you. It just goes to
show what effect the first dose of hot weather
is liable to have on the custard heads. Well,
maybe I oughtn&#8217;t to call &#8217;em that, either. They
can&#8217;t seem to help gettin&#8217; that way, any more&#8217;n
other folks can dodge havin&#8217; bad dreams, or
boils on the neck. And I ain&#8217;t any mind specialist;
so when it comes to sayin&#8217; what&#8217;ll soften
up a man&#8217;s brain, or whether he couldn&#8217;t sidestep
it if he tried, I passes the make.</p>
<p>Now look at this dippy move of Mr. Jarvis&#8217;s.
Guess you don&#8217;t remember him. I&#8217;d
&#8217;most forgot him myself, it&#8217;s so long since he
was around; but he&#8217;s the young chap that owns
that big Blenmont place, the gent that Swifty
and I helped out with the fake match when
he&mdash;&mdash;Well, never mind that yarn. He got
the girl, all right; and as he had everything else
anybody could think of, it should have been a
case of lockin&#8217; trouble on the outside and takin&#8217;
joy for a permanent boarder.</p>
<p>But there the other mornin&#8217;, just as I was
havin&#8217; a breathin&#8217; spell after hammerin&#8217; some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
surplus ego out of a young society sport that
had the idea he could box, the studio door opens,
and in pokes this Mr. Jarvis, actin&#8217; like he&#8217;d
been doped.</p>
<p>Now he&#8217;s a big, husky, full blooded young
gent, that&#8217;s always used himself well, never collected
any bad habits, and knows no more about
being sick than a cat knows about swimmin&#8217;.
Add to that the fact that he&#8217;s one of the unemployed
rich, with more money than he knows
how to spend, and you can figure out how surprised
I am to see that down and out look on
his face. Course, I thinks something serious
has been happenin&#8217; to him, and I treats him real
gentle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Mr. Jarvis!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Somebody
been throwin&#8217; the hooks into you, have they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; says he. &#8220;No, I&mdash;I&#8217;m all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Dropped in to let
me hand you a few vibrations with the mitts?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Shorty,&#8221; says he, fingerin&#8217;
a chair-back sort of hesitatin&#8217;, as if he didn&#8217;t
know whether to sit down or stand up. &#8220;That
is&mdash;er&mdash;I think I don&#8217;t care for a bout to-day.
I&mdash;I&#8217;m hardly in the mood, you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you say,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Have a seat,
anyway. Sure! That one; it&#8217;s reserved for
you. Maybe you come in to enjoy some of my
polite and refined conversation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;the fact is, Shorty,&#8221; says he,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
fixin&#8217; his tie kind of nervous, &#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know
just why I did come in. I think I started for
the club, and as I was passing by in a cab I
looked up here at your windows&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; says I, soothin&#8217;. &#8220;What&#8217;s the
use goin&#8217; to the club when the Physical Culture
Studio is handier? You&#8217;re feelin&#8217; fine as silk;
how&#8217;re you lookin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? Beg pardon?&#8221; says he, gettin&#8217; twisted
up on that mothy gag. &#8220;Oh, I see! I&#8217;m looking
rotten, thank you, and feeling the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;G&#8217;wan!&#8221; says I. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t got any license
to have feelin&#8217;s like that. Guess you got
the symptoms mixed. But where do you think
it hurts most?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it takes five or ten minutes of jollyin&#8217;
like that to pull any details at all out of Jarvis,
and when I does get the whole heartrendin&#8217;
story, I hardly knows whether to give him the
laugh, or to send out for a nursin&#8217; bottle.</p>
<p>Ever seen a great, grown man play the baby
act? Talk about a woman in a cryin&#8217; spell!
That ain&#8217;t a marker to watchin&#8217; a six-foot, one
hundred and eighty-pound free citizen droop
his mouth corners and slump his shoulders over
nothin&#8217; at all. Course, I don&#8217;t always feel like
a hickey boy myself, and I&#8217;ll admit there are
times when the rosy tints get a little clouded up;
but I has my own way of workin&#8217; out of such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
spells before the mullygrubs turns my gray matter
into curdled milk. But Jarvis, he&#8217;s as blue
as a rainy Monday with the wash all in
soak.</p>
<p>In the first place, he&#8217;s been alone for nearly
three whole weeks, the women folks all bein&#8217;
abroad, and it&#8217;s a new experience for him.
Think of that awful calamity happenin&#8217; to a
man of his size! Seems that before he was
married he&#8217;d always carted mother and sister
around, under the idea that he was lookin&#8217; out
for them, when as a matter of fact they was
the ones that was lookin&#8217; after him. Then Mrs.
Jarvis, Lady Evelyn that was, takes him in
hand and makes him more helpless than ever.
He never mistrusts how much he&#8217;s been mollycoddled,
until he finds himself with nobody but
a valet, a housekeeper, and seventeen assorted
servants to help him along in the struggle for
existence.</p>
<p>His first move after the ladies have sailed
is to smoke until his tongue feels like a pussycat&#8217;s
back, eat his lonesome meals at lunch-counter
clip, and work himself into a mild bilious
state. That makes him a little cranky with
the help, and, as there&#8217;s no one around to smooth
&#8217;em out, the cook and half a dozen maids leaves
in a bunch. His head coachman goes off on a
bat, the housekeeper skips out to Ohio to bury
an aunt, and the domestic gear at Blenmont gets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
to runnin&#8217; about as smooth as a flat wheel trolley
car on a new roadbed.</p>
<p>To finish off the horrible situation, Jarvis has
had a misunderstandin&#8217; with a landscape architect
that he&#8217;d engaged to do things to the
grounds. Jarvis had planned to plant a swan
lake in the front yard; but the landscaper points
out that it can&#8217;t be done because there&#8217;s a hill
in the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; says Jarvis, &#8220;these are little
things; but I&#8217;ve been worrying over them
until&mdash;until&mdash;&mdash; Well, I&#8217;m in bad shape,
Shorty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder you&#8217;re still alive,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; says he, groanin&#8217;. &#8220;It is too serious
a matter. Perhaps you don&#8217;t know it, but
I had an uncle that drank himself to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; says I. &#8220;&#8217;Most everybody has had
an uncle of that kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And one of my cousins,&#8221; Jarvis goes on,
lowerin&#8217; his voice and lookin&#8217; around cautious,
&#8220;shot himself&mdash;in the head!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I. And then I begun to get a
glimmer of what he was drivin&#8217; at. &#8220;What!
You don&#8217;t mean that you were thinkin&#8217; of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He groans again and nods his head.</p>
<p>Then I cuts loose. &#8220;Why, look here!&#8221; says
I. &#8220;You soft boiled, mush headed, spineless
imitation of a real man! do you mean to tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
me that, just because you&#8217;ve been tied loose
from a few skirts for a week or so, and have
had to deal with some grouchy hired hands,
you&#8217;ve actually gone jelly brained over it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps that don&#8217;t make him squirm some,
though! He turns white first, and then he gets
the hectic flush. &#8220;Pardon me, McCabe,&#8221; says
he, stiffenin&#8217; up, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t care to have anyone
talk to me like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, pickles!&#8221; says I. &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to you
a good deal straighter&#8217;n that, before I finish!
And you&#8217;ll take it, too! Why, you great, overgrown
kid! what right have you developin&#8217; such
a yellow cur streak as that? You! What you
need is to be laid over that chair and paddled,
and blamed if I don&#8217;t know but I&#8217;d better&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But just here the door creaks, and in drifts
the other one. Hanged if I ever did know what
his real name was. I called him Heiney Kirschwasser
for short, though he says he ain&#8217;t Dutch
at all, but Swiss-French; and that it ain&#8217;t kirsch
that&#8217;s his failin&#8217;, but prune brandy. He&#8217;s the
mop and broom artist for the buildin&#8217;, some
floater the janitor picked up off the sidewalk
a few months back.</p>
<p>He wa&#8217;n&#8217;t exactly a decorative object, this
Heiney; but he&#8217;s kind of a picturesque ruin.
His widest part is around the belt; and from
there he tapers both ways, his shoulders bein&#8217;
a good eight inches narrower; and on top of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
them, with no neck to speak of, is a head shaped
like a gum drop, bald on top, and remindin&#8217; you
of them mountain peaks you see in pictures, or
a ham set on end.</p>
<p>He has a pair of stary, pop eyes, a high colored
beak that might be used as a danger signal,
and a black, shoebrush beard, trimmed close except
for a little spike under the chin, that
gives the lower part of his face a look like
the ace of spades. His mornin&#8217; costume is a
faded blue jumper, brown checked pants, and
an old pair of rubber soled shoes that Swifty
had donated to him.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s Heiney&#8217;s description, as near as I can
get to it. He comes shufflin&#8217; in, luggin&#8217; a scrub
pail in one hand, and draggin&#8217; a mop in the
other, and he looks about as cheerful as a worn-out
hearse that&#8217;s been turned into an ash wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heiney,&#8221; says I, &#8220;you&#8217;re just in time. Still
lookin&#8217; for a nice, comfortable place to die in,
are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Heiney shrugs his shoulders and lifts his eyebrows
in a lifeless sort of style. He does most
of his conversin&#8217; that way; but he can say more
with a few shrugs than Swifty Joe can by usin&#8217;
both sides of his mouth. What Heiney means
is that one place is as good as another, and he
don&#8217;t care how soon he finds it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, cheer up, Heiney,&#8221; says I; &#8220;for I&#8217;ve
just decided to give you the use of my back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
room to shuffle off in. I&#8217;ve got comp&#8217;ny for
you, too. Here&#8217;s a friend of mine that feels
the same way you do. Mr. Jarvis, Mr. Heiney
Kirschwasser.&#8221;</p>
<p>And you should have seen the look of disgust
on Jarvis&#8217;s face as he sizes up the specimen.
&#8220;Oh, I say now, Shorty,&#8221; he begins, &#8220;there&#8217;s
such a thing as&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;G&#8217;wan!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Wa&#8217;n&#8217;t you just tellin&#8217;
me about how you was plannin&#8217; a job for the
coroner? And Heiney&#8217;s been threatenin&#8217; to do
the same thing for weeks. He comes in here
every day or so and talks about jumpin&#8217; off
the dock, or doin&#8217; the air dance. I&#8217;ve been
stavin&#8217; him off with slugs of prune brandy and
doses of good advice; but if a chap like you
has caught the fever, then I see I&#8217;ve been doin&#8217;
wrong not to let Heiney have his way. Now
there&#8217;s the back room, with plenty of rope and
gasjets. Get on in there, both of you, and make
a reg&#8217;lar bee of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Heiney, he stands blinkin&#8217; and starin&#8217; at Jarvis,
until he gets him so nervous he almost
screams.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, Shorty,&#8221; says Jarvis,
&#8220;let&#8217;s not joke about such a subject!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Joke!&#8221; says I. &#8220;You&#8217;re the one that&#8217;s
supplyin&#8217; the comedy here. Now Heiney is serious.
He&#8217;d do the trick in a minute if he had
the nerve. He&#8217;s got things on his mind, Heiney
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
has. And what&#8217;s the odds if they ain&#8217;t so?
Compared to what you&#8217;ve been fussin&#8217; about,
they&#8217;re&mdash;&mdash;Here, Heiney, you tell the gentleman
that tale of yours. Begin where you was
a cook in some seashore hotel in Switzerland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not zeashore! <i>Non</i>!&#8221; says Heiney, droppin&#8217;
his pail and wavin&#8217; one hand. &#8220;Eet ees
at Lack Como, in ze montongs. I am ze head
chef, <i>moi!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you look it!&#8221; says I. &#8220;A fine figure
of a chef you&#8217;d make! wouldn&#8217;t you? Well, go
on: about bein&#8217; full of prunes when they called
on you to season the soup. What was it you
dumped in instead of salt,&mdash;arsenic, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Non, non!</i>&#8221; says Heiney, gettin&#8217; excited.
&#8220;Ze poison for ze r-r-rat. I keep heem in one
tin can, same as ze salt. I am what you call
intoxicate. I make ze mistak&#8217;. Ah, <i>diable!
Deux, trois</i>&mdash;t&#8217;ree hundred guests are zere. Zey
eat ze soup. Zen come by me ze <i>maître d&#8217;hôtel.</i>
He say ze soup ees spoil. Eet has ze foony taste.
Ah, mon <i>Dieu! Mon</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Never mind whether
it was Monday or Tuesday. What did you do
then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Moi</i>? I fly!&#8221; says Heiney. &#8220;I am distract.
I r-r-r-run on ze r-r-r-road. I tear-r-r off
my white apron, my white chapeau. Ah, <i>sacr-r-ré
nom!</i> How my heart is thoomp, thoomp, on
my inside! All night I speak to myself: &#8216;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
have keel zem all! Ze <i>belle</i> ladies! Ze <i>pauvre</i>
shildren! All, you have poi-zon-ed! Zey make
to tweest up on ze floor!&#8217; Ah, <i>diable</i>! Always
I can see zem tweest up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reg&#8217;lar rough on rats carnival, eh?&#8221; says
I. &#8220;Three hundred beautiful ladies and poor
children, not to mention a few men, doin&#8217; the
agony act on the dinin&#8217; room floor! There, Jarvis!
How&#8217;d you like to carry round a movin&#8217;
picture film like that in your mem&#8217;ry? Course,
I&#8217;ve tried to explain to Heiney that nothing of
the kind ever took place; that the papers would
have been full of it; and that he&#8217;d been in the
jug long before this, if it had. But this is
Heiney&#8217;s own particular pipe dream, and he
can&#8217;t let go of it. It&#8217;s got tangled up in the
works somehow, and nothing I can say will jar
it loose. Poor cuss! Look at him! No doubt
about its seemin&#8217; real to him, is there? And
how does your little collection of fleabites show
up alongside it; eh, Jarvis?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jarvis, he&#8217;s gazin&#8217; at Heiney as if this
lump of moldy sweitzerkase was fascinatin&#8217; to
look at.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg pardon,&#8221; says he, &#8220;but you say this
hotel was at Lake Como?&#8221;</p>
<p>Heiney nods his head, then covers his face
with his hands, as if he was seein&#8217; things again.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what was the date of this&mdash;this unfortunate
occurrence?&#8221; says Jarvis.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Year before the last, in Augoost,&#8221; says
Heiney, shudderin&#8217;,&mdash;&#8220;Augoost seven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The seventh of August!&#8221; says Jarvis.
&#8220;And was your hotel the Occident?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Oui, oui</i>!&#8221; says Heiney. &#8220;<i>L&#8217;Hôtel Occident</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess he means Accident,&#8221; says I. &#8220;What
do you know about it, Jarvis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I was there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Here, Heiney, wake up!
Here&#8217;s one of the victims of your rat poison
soup. Does he look as though he&#8217;d been through
that floor tweestin&#8217; orgy?&#8221;</p>
<p>With that Heiney gets mighty interested; but
he ain&#8217;t convinced until Jarvis gives him all
the details, even to namin&#8217; the landlord and describin&#8217;
the head waiter.</p>
<p>&#8220;But ze soup!&#8221; says Heiney. &#8220;Ze poi-zon-ed
soup?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was bad soup,&#8221; says Jarvis; &#8220;but not
quite so bad as that. Nobody could eat it, and
I believe the final report that we had on the
subject was to the effect that a half intoxicated
chef had seasoned it with the powdered alum
that should have gone into the morning rolls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ze alum! Ze alum! Of zat I nevair think!&#8221;
squeals Heiney, flopping down on his knees.
&#8220;Ah, <i>le bon Dieu! Le bon Dieu</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>He clasps his hands in front of him and rolls
his eyes to the ceilin&#8217;. Say, it was the liveliest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
French prayin&#8217; I ever saw; for Heiney is rockin&#8217;
back and forth, his pop eyes leakin&#8217; brine, and
the polly-voo conversation is bubblin&#8217; out of
him like water out of a bu&#8217;sted fire hydrant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, quit it!&#8221; says I. &#8220;This is no camp
meetin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no shuttin&#8217; him off, though, and all
the let-up he takes is to break off now and then
to get Jarvis to tell him once more that it&#8217;s
all true.</p>
<p>&#8220;You make <i>certainement</i>, eh?&#8221; says he.
&#8220;Nobody was keel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a soul,&#8221; says Jarvis. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t even
hear of anyone that was made ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, <i>merci, merci</i>!&#8221; howls Heiney, beginnin&#8217;
the rockin&#8217; horse act again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, for the love of Pete, Heiney!&#8221; says
I, &#8220;will you saw that off before you draw a
crowd? I&#8217;m glad you believe Jarvis, and that
Jarvis believes you; but hanged if I can quite
swallow any such dopy yarn as that without
somethin&#8217; more convincin&#8217;! All I know about
you is that you&#8217;re the worst floor scrubber I
ever saw. And you say you was a cook, do
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cook!&#8221; says Heiney, swellin&#8217; up his chest.
&#8220;I am tell you zat I was ze premier chef. I
have made for myself fame. Everywhere in
<i>l&#8217;Europe</i> zey will tell you of me. For the king
of ze Englise I have made a dinner. <i>Moi!</i> I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
have invent ze sauce Ravignon. From nozzing
at all&mdash;some meat scraps, some leetle greens&mdash;I
produce ze dish ravishment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve heard bluffs like that before,&#8221;
says I; &#8220;but I never saw one made good. Tell
you what I&#8217;ll do, though: In the far corner of
the gym, there, is what Swifty Joe calls his
kitchenet, where he warms up his chowder and
beans. There&#8217;s a two-burner gas stove, an old
fryin&#8217; pan, and a coffee pot. Now here&#8217;s a dollar.
You take that out on Sixth-ave. and spend
it for meat scraps and leetle greens. Then you
come back here, and while Jarvis and I are
takin&#8217; a little exercise, if you can hash up anything
that&#8217;s fit to eat, I&#8217;ll believe your whole
yarn. Do you make the try?&#8221;</p>
<p>Does he? Say, you never saw such a tickled
Frenchy in your life. Before Jarvis and me
had got nicely peeled down for our delayed
boxin&#8217; bout, Heiney is back with his bundles,
has got the fryin&#8217; pan scoured, the gas blazin&#8217;,
and is throwin&#8217; things together like a juggler
doin&#8217; a stage turn.</p>
<p>He sheds the blue jumper, ties a bath towel
around him for an apron, makes a hat out of
a paper bag, and twists some of that stringy
lip decoration of his into a pointed mustache.
Honest, he didn&#8217;t look nor act any more like
the wreck that had dragged the mop in there
half an hour before than I look like Bill Taft.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
And by the time we&#8217;ve had our three rounds
and a rub down, he&#8217;s standin&#8217; doubled up beside
a little table that he&#8217;s found, with his arms
spread out like he was goin&#8217; to take a dive.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Messieurs</i>,&#8221; says he, &#8220;eet ees serve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; says I. &#8220;I&#8217;m just about up to
tacklin&#8217; a hot lunch. What kind of a mess have
you got here, anyway, Heiney? Any alum in
it? Blamed if I don&#8217;t make you put away the
whole shootin&#8217; match if it ain&#8217;t good!&#8221;</p>
<p>How&#8217;s that? Well, say, I couldn&#8217;t name it, or
say whether it was a stew, fry or an omelet, but
for an impromptu sample of fancy grub it was
a little the tastiest article I ever stacked up
against.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; says Jarvis, smackin&#8217; his lips after
the third forkful. &#8220;It&#8217;s <i>ris de veau</i>, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But yes, monsieur!&#8221; says Heiney, his face
lightin&#8217; up. &#8220;Eet ees <i>ris de veau grillé, à la
financier</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s that in English?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Englise,&#8221; says Heiney, shruggin&#8217; his
shoulders, &#8220;eet ees not exist. Eet ees Parisienne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully for Paris, then!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Whatever
it might be if it could be naturalized, it
touches the spot. I take it all back, Heiney.
You&#8217;re the shiftiest chef that ever juggled a
fryin&#8217; pan. A refill on the riddy-voo, seal-voo-plate.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>Well, what do you guess! Jarvis engages
Heiney on the spot, and an hour later they&#8217;ve
started for Blenmont, both of &#8217;em actin&#8217; like
they thought this was a good world to live in,
after all.</p>
<p>Yesterday me and Sadie accepts a special invite
out there to dinner; and it was worth goin&#8217;
out to get. From start to finish it was the finest
that ever happened. Afterwards Jarvis has
Heiney come up from the kitchen and show himself
while we drinks his good health. And say,
in his white togs and starched linen cap, he&#8217;s
got the chef on the canned goods ads. lookin&#8217;
like a hash rustler in a beanery.</p>
<p>As for Jarvis, he&#8217;s got the pink back in his
cheeks, and is holdin&#8217; his chin up once more,
and when we left in the mornin&#8217; he was out
bossin&#8217; a couple of hundred lab&#8217;rers that was
takin&#8217; that hill in wheelbarrows and cartin&#8217; it
off where it wouldn&#8217;t interfere with the lake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shorty,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you
did it, but you&#8217;ve made me a sane man again,
and I owe you more than&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, chuck it!&#8221; says I. &#8220;It was curin&#8217;
Heiney that cured you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; says he. &#8220;Then you are a believer
in homeopathic psychotherapeutics?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Say, write that down
on my cuff by syllables, will you? I want to
spring it on Swifty Joe.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A TRY-OUT FOR TOODLEISM</h3>
</div>

<p>Eh? Yes, maybe I do walk a little stiff
jointed; but, say, I&#8217;m satisfied to be walkin&#8217;
around at all. If I hadn&#8217;t had my luck with
me the other day, I&#8217;d be wearin&#8217; that left leg
in splints and bein&#8217; pushed around in a wheel
chair. As it is, the meat is only a little sore,
and a few more alcohol rubs will put it in
shape.</p>
<p>What was it come so near gettin&#8217; me on the
disabled list? Toodleism! No, I expect you
didn&#8217;t; but let me put you next, son: there&#8217;s
more &#8217;isms and &#8217;pathys and &#8217;ists floatin&#8217; around
these days, than any one head can keep track of.
I don&#8217;t know much about the lot; but this Toodleism&#8217;s
a punk proposition. Besides leavin&#8217;
me with a game prop, it come near bu&#8217;stin&#8217; up
the fam&#8217;ly.</p>
<p>Seems like trouble was lookin&#8217; for me last
week, anyway. First off, I has a run of old
timers, that panhandles me out of all the loose
coin I has in my clothes. You know how they&#8217;ll
come in streaks that way, sometimes? Why, I
was thinkin&#8217; of havin&#8217; &#8217;em form a line, one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
while. Then along about Thursday one of my
back fletchers develops a case of jumps. What&#8217;s
a fletcher? Why, a steak grinder, and this one
has a ripe spot in it. Course, it&#8217;s me for the
nickel plated plush chair, with the footrest and
runnin&#8217; water attached; and after the tooth
doctor has explored my jaw with a rock drill
and a few other cute little tools, he says he&#8217;ll
kill the nerve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Doc.!&#8221; says I. &#8220;That nerve&#8217;s always
been a friend of mine until lately.
Wouldn&#8217;t dopin&#8217; it do?&#8221;</p>
<p>He says it wouldn&#8217;t, that nothin&#8217; less&#8217;n capital
punishment would reform a nerve like that;
so I tells him to blaze away. No use goin&#8217; into
details. Guess you&#8217;ve been there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Doc.,&#8221; says I once when he was fittin&#8217;
a fresh auger into the machine, &#8220;you ain&#8217;t mistakin&#8217;
me for the guilty party, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I hurt?&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t call that ticklin&#8217;, do you?&#8221;
says I.</p>
<p>But he only grins and goes on with the excavation.
After he&#8217;s blasted out a hole big enough
for a terminal tunnel he jabs in a hunk of cotton
soaked with sulphuric acid, and then tamps
down the concrete.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; says he, handin&#8217; me a drug store
drink flavored with formaldehyde. &#8220;In the
course of forty-eight hours or so that nerve will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
be as dead as a piece of string. Meantime it
may throb at intervals.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what it did, too! It dies as hard as
a campaign lie. About every so often, just when
I&#8217;m forgettin&#8217;, it wakes up again, takes a fresh
hold, and proceeds to give an imitation of a
live wire on an alternatin&#8217; circuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahr chee!&#8221; says Swifty Joe. &#8220;To look
at the map of woe you&#8217;re carryin&#8217; around, you&#8217;d
think nobody ever had a bum tusk before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody ever had this one before,&#8221; says I,
&#8220;and the way I look now ain&#8217;t chronic, like
some faces I know of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahr chee!&#8221; says Swifty, which is his way
of bringin&#8217; in a minority report.</p>
<p>The worst of it was, though, I&#8217;m billed to
show up at Rockywold for a May party that
Sadie and Mrs. Purdy-Pell was pullin&#8217; off, and
when I lands there Friday afternoon the jaw
sensations was still on the job. I&#8217;m feeling
about as cheerful and chatty as a Zoo tiger with
ingrowin&#8217; toenails. So, after I&#8217;ve done the polite
handshake, and had a word with Sadie on
the fly, I digs out my exercise uniform and
makes a sneak down into their dinky little gym.,
where there&#8217;s a first class punchin&#8217; bag that I
picked out for Purdy-Pell myself.</p>
<p>You know, I felt like I wanted to hit something,
and hit hard. It wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any idle impulse,
either. That tooth was jumpin&#8217; so I could almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
feel my heels leave the floor, and I had
emotions that it would take more than language
to express proper. So I peels off for it, down
to a sleeveless jersey and a pair of flannel pants,
and starts in to drum out the devil&#8217;s tattoo on
that pigskin bag.</p>
<p>I was so busy relievin&#8217; my feelin&#8217;s that I
didn&#8217;t notice anything float in the door; but
after awhile I looks up and discovers the audience.
She&#8217;s a young female party that I didn&#8217;t
remember havin&#8217; seen before at any of the
Rockywold doin&#8217;s; but it looks like she&#8217;s one of
the guests, all right.</p>
<p>Well, I hadn&#8217;t been introduced, and I couldn&#8217;t
see what she was buttin&#8217; into the gym. for, anyway,
so I keeps right on punchin&#8217; the bag;
thinkin&#8217; that if she was shocked any by my
costume she&#8217;d either get over it, or beat it and
have a fit.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s one of the kind you might expect &#8217;most
anything from,&mdash;one of these long, limp, loppy,
droop eyed fluffs, with terracotta hair, and a
prunes-and-prisms mouth all puckered to say
something soulful. She&#8217;s wearin&#8217; a whackin&#8217;
big black feather lid with a long plume trailin&#8217;
down over one ear, a strawb&#8217;ry pink dress cut
accordin&#8217; to Louis Catorz designs,&mdash;waist band
under her armpits, you know,&mdash;and nineteen-button
length gloves. Finish that off with a
white hen feather boa, have her hands clasped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
real shy under her chin, and you&#8217;ve got a picture
of what I sees there in the door. But it
was the friendly size-up she was givin&#8217; me, and
no mistake. She must have hung up there three
or four minutes too, before she quits, without
sayin&#8217; a word.</p>
<p>At the end of half an hour I was feelin&#8217; some
better; but when I&#8217;d got into my tailor made, I
didn&#8217;t have any great enthusiasm for tacklin&#8217;
food.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll appoint this a special fast day
for mine,&#8221; says I to Sadie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Shorty!&#8221; says she. &#8220;Whatever is
the matter?&#8221; And she has no sooner heard
about the touchy tusk than she says, &#8220;Oh, pooh!
Just say there isn&#8217;t any such thing as toothache.
Pain, you know, is only a false mental
photograph, an error of the mind, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, back up, Sadie!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Do you
dream I don&#8217;t know whether this jump is in
my brain or my jaw? This is no halftone; it&#8217;s
the real thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; says she. &#8220;You come right
downstairs and see Dr. Toodle. He&#8217;ll fix it in
no time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seems this Toodle was the one the party had
been arranged for, and Sadie has to hunt him
up. It didn&#8217;t take long to trail him down; for
pretty soon she comes towin&#8217; him into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
drawin&#8217;-room, where I&#8217;m camped down on a
sofa, holdin&#8217; on with both hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Toodle,&#8221; says she, &#8220;I want to present
Mr. McCabe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t claim any seventh-son powers;
but I only has to take one look at Toodle to
guess that he&#8217;s some sort of a phony article.
No reg&#8217;lar pill distributor would wear around
that mushy look that he has on. He&#8217;s a good
sized, wide shouldered duck, with a thick crop
of long hair that just clears his coat collar, and
one of these smooth, soft, sentimental faces the
women folks go nutty over,&mdash;you know, big nose,
heavy chin, and sagged mouth corners. His
get-up is something between a priest&#8217;s and an
actor&#8217;s,&mdash;frock coat, smooth front black vest,
and a collar buttoned behind. He gurgles out
that he&#8217;s charmed to meet Mr. McCabe, and
wants to know what&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; but a specked tooth,&#8221; says I. &#8220;But
I can stand it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My de-e-ear brother,&#8221; says Toodle, puttin&#8217;
his fingers together and gazin&#8217; down at me like
a prison chaplain givin&#8217; a talk to murderers&#8217;
row, &#8220;you are possessed of mental error. Your
brain focus has been disturbed, and a blurred
image has been cast on the sensitive retina of
the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, say, Doc.,&#8221; says I, &#8220;cut out the preamble!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
If you&#8217;ve got a cocaine gun in your
pocket, dig it up!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he goes off again with another string
of gibberish, about pain bein&#8217; nothin&#8217; but
thought, and thought bein&#8217; something we could
steer to suit ourselves. I can&#8217;t give you the
patter word for word; but the nub of it was that
I could knock that toothache out in one round
just by thinkin&#8217; hard. Now wouldn&#8217;t that peeve
you? What?</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Doc.,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I&#8217;ll try thinkin&#8217;
I ain&#8217;t got any ache, if you&#8217;ll sit here and keep
me comp&#8217;ny by thinkin&#8217; you&#8217;ve had your dinner.
Is it a go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t. He shrugs his shoulders, and
says he&#8217;s afraid I&#8217;m a difficult subject, and then
he teeters off on his toes. Sadie tells me I ought
to be ashamed of myself for tryin&#8217; to be so
fresh.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a very distinguished man,&#8221; she says.
&#8220;He&#8217;s the founder of Toodleism. He&#8217;s written
a book about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought he looked like a nutty one,&#8221; says
I. &#8220;Keep him away from me; I&#8217;ll be all right
by mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The argument might have lasted longer; but
just then comes the dinner call, and they all goes
in where the little necks was waitin&#8217; on the
cracked ice, and I&#8217;m left alone to count the
jumps and enjoy myself. Durin&#8217; one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
calm spells I wanders into the lib&#8217;ry, picks a
funny paper off the table, and settles down in
a cozy corner to read the jokes. I must have
been there near an hour, when in drifts the
loppy young lady in the pink what-d&#8217;ye-call-it,&mdash;the
one I&#8217;d made the silent hit with in the gym.,&mdash;and
she makes straight for me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, here you are!&#8221; says she, like we was
old friends. &#8220;Do you know, I&#8217;ve just heard of
your&mdash;your trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, it ain&#8217;t any killin&#8217; matter,&#8221; says I. &#8220;It
don&#8217;t amount to much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it doesn&#8217;t!&#8221; says she. &#8220;And
that is what I came to talk to you about. I am
Miss Lee,&mdash;Violet Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-e-es?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she goes on, &#8220;I am Dr. Toodle&#8217;s
secretary and assistant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; says I. &#8220;He&#8217;s in luck, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, now!&#8221; says she, just like that, givin&#8217;
me a real giddy tap with her fan. &#8220;You must
be real serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in condition to be all of that,&#8221; says
I. &#8220;Are you plannin&#8217; to try the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to help you to banish the imaginary
pains, Mr. McCabe,&#8221; says she. &#8220;Now
first you must repeat after me the <i>summum
bonum</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very simple,&#8221; says she, floppin&#8217; down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
on the cushions alongside and reachin&#8217; out for
one of my hands. &#8220;It begins this way, &#8216;I am
a child of light and goodness.&#8217; Now say that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Say, how would you duck a proposition of
that kind? There was Violet, with her big eyes
rolled at me real pleadin&#8217;, and her mouth puckered
up real cunning, and the soft, clingin&#8217; grip
on my right paw. Well, I says it over.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; she purrs. &#8220;Now, &#8216;Evil and
fear and pain are the creatures of darkness.&#8217;
Go on!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing!&#8221; says I. &#8220;&#8216;Evil and fear
and&mdash;&mdash;Ouch!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ever feel one of them last gasps that a nerve
gives when it goes out of business? I thought
the top of my head was comin&#8217; off. But it
didn&#8217;t, and a couple of seconds later I knew the
jumpin&#8217; was all over; so I straightens my face
out, and we proceeds with the catechism.</p>
<p>It was a bird, too. I didn&#8217;t mind doin&#8217; it
at all with Miss Lee there to help; for, in spite
of her loppy ways, she&#8217;s more or less of a candy
girl. There was a good deal to it, and it all
means the same as what Toodle was tryin&#8217; to
hand out; but now that the ache has quit I&#8217;m
ready for any kind of foolishness.</p>
<p>Violet had got to the point where she has
snuggled up nice and close, with one hand still
grippin&#8217; mine and the other smoothin&#8217; out my
jaw while she told me again how pain was only a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
pipe dream,&mdash;when I glances over her shoulder
and sees Sadie floatin&#8217; in hangin&#8217; to Dr.
Toodle&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>And does Sadie miss the tableau in our corner?
Not to any extent! Her eyebrows go up,
and her mouth comes open. That&#8217;s the first indication.
Next her lips shut tight, and her eyes
narrow down, and before you could count three
she&#8217;s let go of Toodle as if he was a hot potato,
and she&#8217;s makin&#8217; a bee line for the cozy
corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; says Miss Lee, lookin&#8217; up and forecastin&#8217;
the comin&#8217; conditions in a flash. &#8220;Is
dinner over? Oh, and there&#8217;s Dr. Toodle!&#8221; and
off she trips, leavin&#8217; the McCabe fam&#8217;ly to hold
a reunion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; says Sadie, givin&#8217; me the
gimlet gaze. And say, she puts plenty of expression
into them three words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me either,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Not very often, anyway.
But a chance is a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope I didn&#8217;t intrude?&#8221; says she, her eyes
snappin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no tellin&#8217;,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a very touching scene!&#8221; says she.
&#8220;Very!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wa&#8217;n&#8217;t it?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Nice girl, Violet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Violet! Humph!&#8221; says she. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
accounting for tastes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I was thinkin&#8217; when I see you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
with the timelock clutch on that freak doctor&#8217;s
south wing,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Toodle,&#8221; says she, &#8220;was explaining to
me his wonderful self healing theories.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And dear Violet,&#8221; says I, &#8220;was puttin&#8217; me
through a course of sprouts in the automatic
toothache cure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed!&#8221; says Sadie. &#8220;Was patting
your cheek part of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; says she. &#8220;I suppose it worked?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like a charm,&#8221; says I. &#8220;All that bothers
me now is how I can dig up another pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might have your dear Violet see what
can be done for that soft spot in your head!&#8221;
she snaps. &#8220;Only next time take her off out
of sight, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll attend to that, all right,&#8221; says I.
&#8220;This havin&#8217; a green eyed wife buttin&#8217; in just
at the interestin&#8217; point is something fierce!&#8221;
And that&#8217;s where I spread it on too thick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a chump, Shorty!&#8221; says Sadie,
lettin&#8217; loose a sudden giggle and mussin&#8217; my
hair up with both hands. It&#8217;s a way she has of
gettin&#8217; out of a corner, and she&#8217;s skipped off before
I&#8217;m sure whether she&#8217;s still got a grouch,
or is only lettin&#8217; on.</p>
<p>By that time my appetite has come back; so
I holds up the butler and has him lay out a solitaire
feed. And when I goes back to the crowd
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
again I finds Toodle has the center of the stage,
with the spotlight full on him. All the women
are gathered round, listening to his guff like it
was sound sense. Seems he&#8217;s organized a new
deal on the thought cure stunt, and he&#8217;s workin&#8217;
it for all it&#8217;s worth. The men, though, don&#8217;t
appear so excited over what he&#8217;s sayin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Confounded rubbish, I call it!&#8221; says Mr.
Purdy-Pell.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to hear it from Violet,&#8221; says
I. &#8220;She&#8217;s the star explainer of that combination.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Violet seems to have faded into the background.
We don&#8217;t see anything more of her
that evenin&#8217;, nor she wa&#8217;n&#8217;t in evidence next
mornin&#8217;. Doc. Toodle was, though. He begins
by tellin&#8217; how he never takes anything but hot
water and milk on risin&#8217;; but that in the middle
of the forenoon he makes it a point to put away
about three fresh laid eggs, raw, in a glass of
sherry.</p>
<p>&#8220;How interesting!&#8221; says Mrs. Purdy-Pell.
&#8220;Then we must drive over to Fernbrook Farm,
right after breakfast, and get some of their
lovely White Leghorn eggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the sort of excursion I was rung
into; so the bunch of us piles into the wagonette
and starts for a fresh supply of hen fruit.
When we gets to the farm the superintendent
invites us to take a tour through the incubator
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
houses, and of course they all wants to see the
dear little chickies and so on. All but me. I
stays and chins with the coachman while he
walks the horses around the driveway.</p>
<p>In about half an hour they comes troopin&#8217;
back, Toodle in the lead, luggin&#8217; a paper bag full
of warm eggs. He don&#8217;t wait for the others,
but pikes for the wagonette and climbs in one
of the side seats facin&#8217; me. We was just turnin&#8217;
to back up to the block for the ladies, when a
yellow kyoodle dashes around the corner after
a cat. Them skittish horses was just waitin&#8217;
for some such excuse as that, and before Mr.
Driver can put the curb bit on &#8217;em hard enough
they&#8217;ve done a quick pivot, cramped the wheels,
and turned us over on the soggy grass as neat
as anything you ever see.</p>
<p>Me bein&#8217; on the low side, I strikes the
ground first; but before I can squirm out, down
comes Toodle on top, landin&#8217; his one hundred
and ninety pounds so sudden that it knocks the
wind clear out of me. He&#8217;s turned over on the
way down, so I&#8217;ve got his shoulder borin&#8217; into
my chest and the heavy part of him on my
leg.</p>
<p>Course, the women squeals, and the horses cut
up some; but the driver has landed on his feet
and has them by the head in no time at all, so
we wa&#8217;n&#8217;t dragged around any. Noticin&#8217; that, I
lays still and waits for Toodle to pry himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
loose. But the Doc. don&#8217;t seem in any hurry to
move, and the next thing I know I hear him
groanin&#8217; and mumblin&#8217; under his breath. Between
groans he was tryin&#8217; to say over that rigmarole
of his.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a child of light&mdash;Oh, dear me!&mdash;of
light and goodness!&#8221; he was pantin&#8217; out.
&#8220;Evil and fear and&mdash;Oh, my poor back!&mdash;and
pain are creatures of&mdash;Oh my, oh my!&mdash;of darkness!
Nothing can harm me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, something is goin&#8217; to harm you mighty
sudden,&#8221; says I, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t let me up out
of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my life blood!&#8221; he groans. &#8220;I can
feel my life blood! Oh, oh! I am a child
of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, slush!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Get up and shake
yourself. Think I&#8217;m a bloomin&#8217; prayer rug
that you can squat on all day? Roll over!&#8221; and
I manages to hand him a short arm punch in
the ribs that stirs him up enough so I can slide
out from under. Soon&#8217;s I get on my feet and
can hop around once or twice I finds there&#8217;s no
bones stickin&#8217; through, and then I turns to have
a look at him.</p>
<p>And say, I wouldn&#8217;t have missed that exhibition
for twice the shakin&#8217; up I got! There he
is, stretched out on the wet turf, his eyelids
flutterin&#8217;, his breath comin&#8217; fast, and his two
hands huggin&#8217; tight what&#8217;s left of that bu&#8217;sted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
paper bag, right up against the front of his
preacher&#8217;s vest. And can you guess what&#8217;s happened
to them eggs?</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my life blood!&#8221; he keeps on moanin&#8217;.
&#8220;I can feel it oozing through&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;re switched, Toodle!&#8221; says I.
&#8220;Your brain kodak is out of register, that&#8217;s all.
It ain&#8217;t life blood you&#8217;re losin&#8217;; it&#8217;s only your
new laid omelet that&#8217;s leakin&#8217; over your vest
front.&#8221;</p>
<p>About then I gets a squint at Sadie and Mrs.
Purdy-Pell, and they&#8217;re almost chokin&#8217; to death
in a funny fit.</p>
<p>Well, say, that was the finish of Toodleism
with the Rockywold bunch. The Doc. didn&#8217;t
have a scratch nor a bruise on him, and after
he&#8217;d been helped up and scraped off, he was
almost as good as new. But his conversation
works is clogged for good, and he has his chin
down on his collar. They sends him and Violet
down to catch the next train, and Sadie and Mrs.
Purdy-Pell spends the rest of the day givin&#8217;
imitations of how Toodle hugged up the eggs
and grunted that he was a child of light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I don&#8217;t believe there was something
in what he said,&#8221; Sadie explains to me
afterwards; &#8220;only&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only he was a false alarm, eh?&#8221; says I.
&#8220;Well, Violet wa&#8217;n&#8217;t that kind, anyway.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; says she. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll brag
about Violet for the rest of your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can you keep &#8217;em guessin&#8217; long, when it comes
to things of that kind? Not if they&#8217;re like
Sadie.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE CASE OF THE TISCOTTS</h3>
</div>

<p>What I had on the slate for this part&#8217;cular
afternoon was a brisk walk up Broadway as far
as the gasoline district and a little soothin&#8217; conversation
with Mr. Cecil Slattery about the new
roadster he&#8217;s tryin&#8217; to Paladino me into placin&#8217;
my order for. I&#8217;d just washed up and was in
the gym. giving my coat a few licks with the
whisk broom, when Swifty Joe comes tiptoein&#8217;
in, taps me on the shoulder, and points solemn
into the front office.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; says I, &#8220;break it to me
gentle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get into it quick!&#8221; says he, grabbin&#8217; the
coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Fire, police, or what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;S-s-sh!&#8221; says he. &#8220;Lady to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind,&#8221; says I, &#8220;perfect, or just plain
lady? And what&#8217;s her name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahr-r-r chee!&#8221; he whispers, hoarse and
stagy. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you it was a lady? Get
a move on!&#8221; and he lifts me into the sleeves
and yanks away the whisk broom.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Swifty,&#8221; says I, &#8220;if this is another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
of them hot air demonstrators, or a book
agent, there&#8217;ll be trouble comin&#8217; your way in
bunches! Remember, now!&#8221;</p>
<p>Here was once, though, when Swifty hadn&#8217;t
made any mistake. Not that he shows such wonderful
intelligence in this case. With her
wearin&#8217; all them expensive furs, and the cute
little English footman standin&#8217; up straight in
his yellow topped boots over by the door, who
wouldn&#8217;t have known she was a real lady?</p>
<p>She&#8217;s got up all in black, not exactly a
mournin&#8217; costume, but one of these real broadcloth
regalias, plain but classy. She&#8217;s a tall,
slim party, and from the three-quarters&#8217; view I
gets against the light I should guess she was
goin&#8217; on thirty or a little past it. All she&#8217;s
armed with is a roll of paper, and as I steps in
she&#8217;s drummin&#8217; with it on the window sill.</p>
<p>Course, we has all kinds driftin&#8217; into the
studio here, by mistake and otherwise, and I
gen&#8217;rally makes a guess on &#8217;em right; but this
one don&#8217;t suggest anything at all. Even that
rat faced tiger of hers could have told her this
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any French millinery parlor, and she
didn&#8217;t look like one who&#8217;d get off the trail anyway.
So I plays a safety by coughin&#8217; polite behind
my hand and lettin&#8217; her make the break.
She ain&#8217;t backward about it, either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, there you are, Professor McCabe!&#8221;
says she, in that gushy, up and down tone, like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
she was usin&#8217; language as some sort of throat
gargle. &#8220;How perfectly dear of you to be here,
too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; says I. &#8220;I&#8217;ve kind of got
into the habit of bein&#8217; here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, now!&#8221; says she, smilin&#8217; just as
though we was carryin&#8217; on a sensible conversation.
And it&#8217;s a swagger stunt too, this talkin&#8217;
without sayin&#8217; anything. When you get so you
can keep it up for an hour you&#8217;re qualified either
for the afternoon tea class or the batty ward.
But the lady ain&#8217;t here just to pay a social call.
She makes a quick shift and announces that
she&#8217;s Miss Colliver, also hoping that I remember
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sure,&#8221; says I. &#8220;Miss Ann, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the only time we was
ever within speakin&#8217; distance was once at the
Purdy-Pells&#8217; when she blew in for a minute just
at dinner time, lifted a bunch of American Beauties
off the table with the excuse that they was
just what she wanted to send to the Blind Asylum,
and blew out again.</p>
<p>But of course I couldn&#8217;t help knowin&#8217; who
she was and all about her. Ain&#8217;t the papers
always full of her charity doin&#8217;s, her funds for
this and that, and her new discoveries of
shockin&#8217; things about the poor? Ain&#8217;t she built
up a rep as a lady philanthropist that&#8217;s too busy
doing good to ever get married? Maybe Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
Russell Sage and Helen Gould has gained a few
laps on her lately; but when it comes to startin&#8217;
things for the Tattered Tenth there ain&#8217;t many
others that&#8217;s got much on her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; thinks I. &#8220;Wonder what she&#8217;s
going to do for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>I ain&#8217;t left long in doubt. She backs me up
against the desk and cuts loose with the straight
talk. &#8220;I came in to tell you about my new
enterprise, Piny Crest Court,&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apartment house, is it?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; says she. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you read
about it? It&#8217;s to be a white plague station for
working girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A white&mdash;white&mdash;&mdash;Oh! For lungers,
eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We never speak of them in that way, you
know,&#8221; says she, handin&#8217; me the reprovin&#8217; look.
&#8220;Piny Crest Court is the name I&#8217;ve given to
the site. Rather sweet, is it not? Really there
are no pines on it, you know; but I shall have
a few set out. The buildings are to be perfectly
lovely. I&#8217;ve just seen the architect&#8217;s
plans,&mdash;four open front cottages grouped
around an administration infirmary, the superintendent&#8217;s
office to be finished in white mahogany
and gold, and the directors&#8217; room in Circassian
walnut, with a stucco frieze after della
Robbia. Don&#8217;t you simply love those Robbia
bambinos?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Great!&#8221; says I, lyin&#8217; as easy and genteel
as if I had lots of practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am simply crazy to have the work
started,&#8221; she goes on; &#8220;so I am spending three
afternoons a week in filling up my lists. Everyone
responds so heartily, too. Now, let me see,
I believe I have put you down for a life membership.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I, gaspin&#8217; some; for it ain&#8217;t
often I&#8217;m elected to things.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will have the privilege of voting for
board members and of recommending two applicants
a year. A life membership is two hundred
and fifty dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean I get two-fifty,&#8221; says I, &#8220;for&mdash;for
just&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I came to. And, say, did you ever know
such a bonehead? Honest, though, from all I&#8217;d
heard of the way she spreads her money around,
and the patronizin&#8217; style she has of puttin&#8217; this
proposition up to me, I couldn&#8217;t tell for a minute
how she meant it. And when I suddenly surrounds
the idea that it&#8217;s me gives up the two-fifty,
I&#8217;m so fussed that I drops back into the
chair and begins to hunt through the desk for my
checkbook. And then I feels myself growin&#8217; a
little warm behind the ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you just put me down offhand for two
hundred and fifty, did you?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wish,&#8221; says she, &#8220;you may take out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
a life certificate for each member of your family.
Several have done that. Let me show you
my list of subscribers. See, here are some of
the prominent merchants and manufacturing
firms. I haven&#8217;t begun on the brokers and bankers
yet; but you will be in good company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-e-es?&#8221; says I, runnin&#8217; my eye over the
firm names. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know much about
this scheme of yours, Miss Colliver.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it is for working girls,&#8221; says she,
&#8220;who are victims of the white plague. We take
them up to Piny Crest and cure them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of working?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of the plague,&#8221; says she. &#8220;It is going to
be the grandest thing I&#8217;ve done yet. And I
have the names of such a lot of the most interesting
cases; poor creatures, you know, who are
suffering in the most wretched quarters. I do
hope they will last until the station is finished.
It means finding a new lot, if they don&#8217;t, and
the public organizations are becoming so active
in that sort of thing, don&#8217;t you see?&#8221;</p>
<p>Somehow, I don&#8217;t catch it all, she puts over
her ideas so fast; but I gather that she&#8217;d like to
have me come up prompt with my little old two-fifty
so she can get busy givin&#8217; out the contracts.
Seein&#8217; me still hangin&#8217; back, though, she&#8217;s
willin&#8217; to spend a few minutes more in describin&#8217;
some of the worst cases, which she proceeds
to do.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We estimate,&#8221; says Miss Ann as a final
clincher, &#8220;that the average cost is about fifty
dollars per patient. Now,&#8221; and she sticks the
subscription list into my fist, &#8220;here is an opportunity!
Do you wish to save five human
lives?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ever had it thrown into you like that? The
sensation is a good deal like bein&#8217; tied to a post
and havin&#8217; your pockets frisked by a holdup
gang. Anyway, that&#8217;s the way I felt, and then
the next minute I&#8217;m ashamed of havin&#8217; any such
feelings at all; for there&#8217;s no denyin&#8217; that dozens
of cases like she mentions can be dug up in
any crowded block. Seems kind of inhuman,
too, not to want chip in and help save &#8217;em. And
yet there I was gettin&#8217; grouchy over it, without
knowin&#8217; why!</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says I, squirmin&#8217; in the chair, &#8220;I&#8217;d
like to save five hundred, if I could. How many
do you say you&#8217;re going to take care of up at
this new place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sixty,&#8221; says she. &#8220;I select the most pitiful
cases. I am taking some things to one of
them now. I wish you could see the awful
misery in that home! I could take you down
there, you know, and show you what a squalid
existence they lead, these Tiscotts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tiscotts!&#8221; says I, prickin&#8217; up my ears.
&#8220;What Tiscotts? What&#8217;s his first name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard the husband mentioned,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
says Miss Ann. &#8220;I doubt if there is one. The
woman&#8217;s name, I think, is Mrs. Anthony Tiscott.
Of course, unless you are really interested&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to go when you
are.&#8221;</p>
<p>That seems to jar Miss Colliver some, and
she tries a little shifty sidestepping; but I puts
it up to her as flat as she had handed it to me
about savin&#8217; the five lives. It was either make
good or welsh, and she comes to the scratch
cheerful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; says she, &#8220;we will drive
down there at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s me into the Victoria alongside of Miss
Ann, with the fat coachman pilotin&#8217; us down
Fifth-ave. to 14th, then across to Third-ave.,
and again down and over to the far East
Side.</p>
<p>I forget the exact block; but it&#8217;s one of the
old style double-deckers, with rusty fire escapes
decorated with beddin&#8217; hung out to air, dark
hallways that has a perfume a garbage cart
would be ashamed of, rickety stairs, plasterin&#8217;
all gone off the halls, and other usual signs of
real estate that the agents squeeze fifteen per
cent. out of. You know how it&#8217;s done, by fixin&#8217;
the Buildin&#8217; and Board of Health inspectors,
jammin&#8217; from six to ten fam&#8217;lies in on a floor,
never makin&#8217; any repairs, and collectin&#8217; weekly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
rents or servin&#8217; dispossess notices prompt when
they don&#8217;t pay up.</p>
<p>Lovely place to hang up one of the &#8220;Home,
Sweet Home&#8221; mottoes! There&#8217;s a water tap in
every hall, so all the tenants can have as much
as they want, stove holes in most of the rooms,
and you buy your coal by the bucket at the rate
of about fourteen dollars a ton. Only three
a week for a room, twelve dollars a month.
Course, that&#8217;s more per room than you&#8217;d pay
on the upper West Side with steam heat, elevator
service, and a Tennessee marble entrance
hall thrown in; but the luxury of stowin&#8217; a
whole fam&#8217;ly into one room comes high. Or
maybe the landlords are doin&#8217; it to discourage
poverty.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is where the Tiscotts hang out, is it?&#8221;
says I. &#8220;Shall I lug the basket for you, Miss
Colliver?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear no!&#8221; says she. &#8220;I never go into such
places. I always send the things in by Hutchins.
He will bring Mrs. Tiscott down and she
will tell us about her troubles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let Hutchins sit on the box this time,&#8221; says
I, grabbin&#8217; up the basket. &#8220;Besides, I don&#8217;t
want any second hand report.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely,&#8221; puts in Miss Ann, &#8220;you are
not going into such a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; says I. &#8220;I begun livin&#8217; in one
just like it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>At that Miss Ann settles back under the robe,
shrugs her shoulders into her furs, and waves
for me to go ahead.</p>
<p>Half a dozen kids on the doorstep told me in
chorus where I&#8217;d find the Tiscotts, and after
I&#8217;ve climbed up through four layers of stale
cabbage and fried onion smells and felt my way
along to the third door left from the top of the
stairs, I makes my entrance as the special messenger
of the ministerin&#8217; angel.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the usual fam&#8217;ly-room tenement scene,
such as the slum writers are so fond of describin&#8217;
with the agony pedal down hard, only
there ain&#8217;t quite so much dirt and rags in evidence
as they&#8217;d like. There&#8217;s plenty, though.
Also there&#8217;s a lot of industry on view. Over
by the light shaft window is Mrs. Tiscott,
pumpin&#8217; a sewin&#8217; machine like she was entered
in a twenty-four-hour endurance race, with a
big bundle of raw materials at one side. In
front of her is the oldest girl, sewin&#8217; buttons
onto white goods; while the three younger kids,
includin&#8217; the four-year-old boy, are spread out
around the table in the middle of the room,
pickin&#8217; nut meat into the dishpan.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the use of tellin&#8217; how Mrs. Tiscott&#8217;s
stringy hair was bobbed up, or the kind of wrapper
she had on? You wouldn&#8217;t expect her to
be sportin&#8217; a Sixth-ave. built pompadour, or
a lingerie reception gown, would you? And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
where they don&#8217;t have Swedish nursery governesses
and porcelain tubs, the youngsters are
apt not to be so&mdash;&mdash;But maybe you&#8217;ll relish
your nut candy and walnut cake better if we
skip some details about the state of the kids&#8217;
hands. What&#8217;s the odds where the contractors
gets such work done, so long as they can shave
their estimates?</p>
<p>The really int&#8217;restin&#8217; exhibit in this fam&#8217;ly
group, of course, is the bent shouldered, peaked
faced girl who has humped herself almost double
and is slappin&#8217; little pearl buttons on white
goods at the rate of twenty a minute. And
there&#8217;s no deception about her being a fine case
for Piny Crest. You don&#8217;t even have to hear
that bark of hers to know it.</p>
<p>I stands there lookin&#8217; &#8217;em over for a whole
minute before anybody pays any attention to
me. Then Mrs. Tiscott glances up and stops
her machine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; she sings out. &#8220;What do
you&mdash;&mdash;Why! Well, of all things, Shorty McCabe,
what brings you here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m playin&#8217; errand boy for the kind Miss
Colliver,&#8221; says I, holdin&#8217; up the basket.</p>
<p>Is there a grand rush my way, and glad cries,
and tears of joy? Nothing doing in the thankful
hysterics line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; says Mrs. Tiscott. &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s see
what it is this time.&#8221; And she proceeds to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
dump out Miss Ann&#8217;s contribution. There&#8217;s a
glass of gooseb&#8217;ry bar le duc, another of guava
jelly, a little can of pâté de foie gras, and half
a dozen lady fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; says she, shovin&#8217; the truck over on
the window sill. As she&#8217;s expressed my sentiments
too, I lets it go at that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like one of your busy days,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of &#8217;em!&#8221; says she with a snort, yankin&#8217;
some more pieces out of the bundle and slippin&#8217;
a fresh spool of cotton onto the machine.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the job?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Baby dresses,&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good money in it?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure!&#8221; says she. &#8220;Forty cents a
dozen is good, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What noble merchant prince is so generous
to you as all that?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tiscott, she shoves over the sweater&#8217;s
shop tag so I can read for myself. Curious,&mdash;wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
it?&mdash;but it&#8217;s the same firm whose name
heads the Piny Crest subscription list. It&#8217;s
time to change the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s Annie?&#8221; says I, lookin&#8217; over at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her cough don&#8217;t seem to get any better,&#8221;
says Mrs. Tiscott. &#8220;She&#8217;s had it since she
had to quit work in the gas mantle shop. That&#8217;s
where she got it. The dust, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, I knew. &#8220;How about Tony?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tony!&#8221; says she, hard and bitter. &#8220;How
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
do I know? He ain&#8217;t been near us for a month
past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sends in something of a Saturday, don&#8217;t
he?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would I be lettin&#8217; the likes of her&mdash;that
Miss Colliver&mdash;come here if he did,&#8221; says she,
&#8220;or workin&#8217; my eyes out like this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Lizzie was in a store?&#8221; says I,
noddin&#8217; towards the twelve-year-old girl at the
nut pickin&#8217; table.</p>
<p>&#8220;They always lays off half the bundle girls
after Christmas,&#8221; says Mrs. Tiscott. &#8220;That&#8217;s
why we don&#8217;t see Tony regular every payday
any more. He had the nerve to claim most of
Lizzie&#8217;s envelope.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then it was my turn to say &#8220;Huh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you have him up?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a-scared,&#8221; says she. &#8220;He&#8217;s promised
to break my head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think he would?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; says she. &#8220;He&#8217;s changed for the
worse lately. He&#8217;d do it, all right, if I took him
to court.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if I stood ready to break his, eh?&#8221;
says I. &#8220;Would that hold him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Say, it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t an elevatin&#8217; or cheerful conversation
me and Mrs. Tiscott indulged in; but
it was more or less to the point. She&#8217;s some
int&#8217;rested in the last proposition of mine, and
when I adds a few frills about givin&#8217; a butcher&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
order and standin&#8217; for a sack of potatoes, she
agrees to swear out the summons for Tony,
providin&#8217; I&#8217;ll hand it to him and be in court
to scare the liver out of him when she talks to
the Justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to do it too,&#8221; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but no meat or potatoes
from me unless you do!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds kind of harsh, don&#8217;t it? You&#8217;d think
I had a special grudge against Tony Tiscott too.
But say, it&#8217;s only because I know him and his
kind so well. Nothing so peculiar about his
case. Lots of them swell coachmen go that way,
and in his day Tony has driven for some big
people. Him and me got acquainted when he
was wearin&#8217; the Twombley-Crane livery and
drawin&#8217; down his sixty-five a month. That
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t so long ago, either.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s hard waitin&#8217; hours on the box in
cold weather, and they get to boozin&#8217;. When
they hit it up too free they lose their places.
After they&#8217;ve lost too many places they don&#8217;t
get any more. Meantime they&#8217;ve accumulated
rheumatism and a fam&#8217;ly of kids. They&#8217;ve got
lazy habits too, and new jobs don&#8217;t come easy
at forty. The next degree is loafin&#8217; around
home permanent; but they ain&#8217;t apt to find that
so pleasant unless the wife is a good hustler.
Most likely she rows it. So they chuck the
fam&#8217;ly and drift off by themselves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the sort of chaps you&#8217;ll find on the
bread lines. But Tony hadn&#8217;t quite got to that
yet. I knew the corner beer joint where he did
odd jobs as free lunch carver and window
cleaner. Also I knew the line of talk I meant to
hand out to him when I got my fingers on his
collar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; says Miss Ann, when I comes back
with the empty basket. &#8220;Did you find it an
interesting case?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s the word,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw the young woman, did you?&#8221; says
she, &#8220;the one who&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; says I. &#8220;She&#8217;s got it&mdash;bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; says Miss Ann, brightenin&#8217; up.
&#8220;And now about that life membership!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says I, &#8220;the Piny Crest proposition
is all right, and I&#8217;d like to see it started;
but the fact is, Miss Colliver, if I should put my
name down with all them big people I&#8217;d be
runnin&#8217; out of my class.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would be&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;Beg pardon,&#8221; says
she, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t think I quite get you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d suspected she wouldn&#8217;t. But how was I
going to dope out to her clear and straight
what&#8217;s so muddled up in my own head? You
know, all about how Annie got her cough, and
my feelin&#8217;s towards the firms that&#8217;s sweatin&#8217;
the Tiscotts, from the baby up, and a lot of
other things that I can&#8217;t state.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As I said,&#8221; goes on Miss Colliver, &#8220;I
hardly think I understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me either,&#8221; says I. &#8220;My head&#8217;s just a
merry go round of whys and whatfors. But, as
far as that fund of yours goes, I don&#8217;t come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; says she. &#8220;That, at least, is
quite definite. Home, Hutchins!&#8221;</p>
<p>And there I am left on the curb lookin&#8217; foolish.
Me, I don&#8217;t ride back to the studio on any
broadcloth cushions! Serves me right too, I
expect. I feels mean and low down all the rest
of the day, until I gets some satisfaction by
huntin&#8217; up Tony and throwin&#8217; such a scare into
him that he goes out and finds a porter&#8217;s job
and swears by all that&#8217;s holy he&#8217;ll take up with
the fam&#8217;ly again.</p>
<p>But think of the chance I passed up of
breakin&#8217; into the high toned philanthropy class!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>CLASSING TUTWATER RIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>Maybe that brass plate had been up in the
lower hall of our buildin&#8217; a month or so before
I takes any partic&#8217;lar notice of it. Even when
I did get my eye on it one mornin&#8217; it only gets
me mildly curious. &#8220;Tutwater, Director of Enterprises,
Room 37, Fourth Floor,&#8221; is all it says
on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; thinks I. &#8220;That&#8217;s goin&#8217; some for
a nine by ten coop under the skylight.&#8221;</p>
<p>And with that I should have let it drop, I
expect. But what&#8217;s the use? Where&#8217;s the fun
of livin&#8217;, if you can&#8217;t mix in now and then. And
you know how I am.</p>
<p>Well, I comes pikin&#8217; up the stairs one day not
long after discoverin&#8217; the sign, and here on my
landin&#8217;, right in front of the studio door, I finds
this Greek that runs the towel supply wagon
usin&#8217; up his entire United States vocabulary on
a strange gent that he&#8217;s backed into a corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy, there, easy, Mr. Poulykopolis!&#8221; says
I. &#8220;This ain&#8217;t any golf links, where you can
smoke up the atmosphere with language like
that. What&#8217;s the row, anyway?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No pay for five week; always nex&#8217; time,
he tells, nex&#8217; time. Gr-r-r-r! I am strong to
slap his life out, me!&#8221; says Pouly, thumpin&#8217;
his chest and shakin&#8217; his black curls. They sure
are fierce actin&#8217; citizens when they&#8217;re excited,
these Marathoners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you would!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Slap his life
out? G&#8217;wan! If he handed you one jolt you
wouldn&#8217;t stop runnin&#8217; for a week. How big is
this national debt you say he owes you! How
much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five week!&#8221; says Pouly. &#8220;One dollar
twenty-five.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sufferin&#8217; Shylocks! All of that? Well,
neighbor,&#8221; says I to the strange gent, &#8220;has he
stated it correct?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly, sir, perfectly,&#8221; says the party of
the second part. &#8220;I do not deny the indebtedness
in the least. I was merely trying to explain
to this agent of cleanliness that, having been
unable to get to the bank this morning, I should
be obliged to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course,&#8221; says I. &#8220;And in that
case allow me to stake you to the price of peace.
Here you are, Pouly. Now go out in the sun
and cool off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear sir,&#8221; says the stranger, followin&#8217;
me into the front office, &#8220;permit me to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, never mind the resolutions!&#8221; says I,
&#8220;It was worth riskin&#8217; that much for the sake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
of stoppin&#8217; the riot. Yes, I know you&#8217;ll pay it
back. Let&#8217;s see, which is your floor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Top, sir,&#8221; says he, &#8220;room 37.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh ho!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Then you&#8217;re the enterprise
director, Tutwater?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And your very humble servant, sir,&#8221; says
he, bringin&#8217; his yellow Panama lid off with a
full arm sweep, and throwin&#8217; one leg graceful
over the back of a chair.</p>
<p>At that I takes a closer look at him, and before
I&#8217;ve got half through the inspection I&#8217;ve
waved a sad farewell to that one twenty-five.
From the frayed necktie down to the runover
shoes, Tutwater is a walkin&#8217; example of the
poor debtor&#8217;s oath. The shiny seams of the
black frock coat shouts of home pressin&#8217;, and
the limp way his white vest fits him suggests
that he does his own laundry work in the washbowl.
But he&#8217;s clean shaved and clean brushed,
and you can guess he&#8217;s seen the time when he
had such things done for him in style.</p>
<p>Yet there ain&#8217;t anything about the way Tutwater
carries himself that signifies he&#8217;s down
and out. Not much! He&#8217;s got the easy, confident
swing to his shoulders that you might expect
from a sport who&#8217;d just picked three winners
runnin&#8217;.</p>
<p>Rather a tall, fairly well built gent he is, with
a good chest on him, and he has one of these
eager, earnest faces that shows he&#8217;s alive all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
time. You wouldn&#8217;t call him a handsome man,
though, on account of the deep furrows down
each side of his cheeks and the prominent jut
to his eyebrows; but, somehow, when he gets
to talkin&#8217;, them eyes of his lights up so you
forget the rest of his features.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve seen chaps like that. Gen&#8217;rally they&#8217;re
cranks of some kind or other, and when they
ain&#8217;t they&#8217;re topliners. So I puts Tutwater
down as belongin&#8217; to the crank class, and it
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t long before he begun livin&#8217; up to the
description.</p>
<p>&#8220;Director of enterprises, eh?&#8221; says I.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a new one on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; says he, wavin&#8217; his hand, &#8220;considering
that I am first in the field. It is a
profession I am creating.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Well, how are you comin&#8217;
on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellently, sir, excellently,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I
have found, for the first time in my somewhat
varied career, full scope for what I am pleased
to call my talents. Of course, the work of preparing
the ground is a slow process, and the&mdash;er&mdash;ahem&mdash;the
results have not as yet begun to
materialize; but when Opportunity comes my
way, sir&mdash;&mdash;Aha! Ha, ha! Ho, ho! Well,
then we shall see if Tutwater is not ready for
her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; says I. &#8220;You with your hand on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
the knob, eh? It&#8217;s an easy way of passin&#8217; the
time too; that is, providin&#8217; such things as visits
from the landlord and the towel collector don&#8217;t
worry you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Merely petty annoyances,
thorns and pebbles in the pathways
that lead to each high emprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Say, it was almost like hearin&#8217; some one read
po&#8217;try, listenin&#8217; to Tutwater talk; didn&#8217;t mean
much of anything, and sounded kind of good.
At the end of half an hour I didn&#8217;t know any
more about his game than at the beginning. I
gathered, though, that up to date it hadn&#8217;t produced
any ready cash, and that Tutwater had
been on his uppers for some time.</p>
<p>He was no grafter, though. That dollar
twenty-five weighed heavier on his mind than
it did on mine. He&#8217;d come in and talk about not
bein&#8217; able to pay it back real regretful, without
even hintin&#8217; at another touch. And little by
little I got more light on Tutwater, includin&#8217;
some details of what he called his career.</p>
<p>There was a lot to it, so far as variety went.
He&#8217;d been a hist&#8217;ry professor in some one-horse
Western college, had tried his luck once up at
Nome, had canvassed for a patent dishwasher
through Michigan, done a ballyhoo trick outside
a travelin&#8217; tent show, and had given bump lectures
on the schoolhouse circuit.</p>
<p>But his prize stunt was when he broke into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
the real estate business and laid out Eucalyptus
City. That was out in Iowa somewhere, and
he&#8217;d have cleaned up a cool million in money if
the blamed trolley company hadn&#8217;t built their
line seven miles off in the other direction.</p>
<p>It was gettin&#8217; this raw deal that convinces him
the seed district wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any place for a gent of
his abilities. So he sold out his options on the
site of Eucalyptus to a brick makin&#8217; concern,
and beat it for 42d-st. with a capital of eighty-nine
dollars cash and this great director scheme
in his head. The brass plate had cost him four
dollars and fifty cents, one month&#8217;s rent of the
upstairs coop had set him back thirty more, and
he&#8217;d been livin&#8217; on the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;But look here, Tutty,&#8221; says I, &#8220;just
what sort of enterprise do you think you can
direct?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any sort,&#8221; says he, &#8220;anything, from running
an international exposition, to putting an
icecream parlor on a paying basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you find your modesty something of
a handicap?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m modest enough,&#8221; he goes on.
&#8220;For instance, I don&#8217;t claim to invent new
methods. I just adapt, pick out lines of proved
success, and develop. Now, your business here&mdash;why,
I could take hold of it, and in six months&#8217;
time I&#8217;d have you occupying this entire building,
with classes on every floor, a solarium on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
the roof, a corps of assistants working day and
night shifts, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I breaks in, &#8220;and then the Sheriff
tackin&#8217; a foreclosure notice on the front door.
I know how them boom methods work out,
Tutty.&#8221;</p>
<p>But talk like that don&#8217;t discourage Tutwater
at all. He hangs onto his great scheme, keepin&#8217;
his eyes and ears open, writin&#8217; letters when he
can scare up money for postage, and insistin&#8217;
that sooner or later he&#8217;ll get his chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is the place for such chances to occur,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;and I know what I can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but if I was you I&#8217;d
trail down some pavin&#8217; job before the paper
inner soles wore clean through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Course, how soon he hit the bread line wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
any funeral of mine exactly, and he was a hopeless
case anyway; but somehow I got to likin&#8217;
Tutwater more or less, and wishin&#8217; there was
some plan of applyin&#8217; all that hot air of his in
useful ways. I know of lots of stiffs with not
half his brains that makes enough to ride around
in taxis and order custom made shirts. He was
gettin&#8217; seedier every week, though, and I had
it straight from the agent that it was only a
question of a few days before that brass plate
would have to come down.</p>
<p>And then, one noon as we was chinnin&#8217; here
in the front office, in blows a portly, red faced,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
stary eyed old party who seems kind of dazed
and uncertain as to where he&#8217;s goin&#8217;. He looks
first at Tutwater, and then at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Same to you and many of &#8217;em,&#8221; says I.
&#8220;What&#8217;ll it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;McCabe was the name,&#8221; says he; &#8220;Professor
McCabe, I think. I had it written down
somewhere; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; says I. &#8220;This is the shop
and I&#8217;m the right party. What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you don&#8217;t know me?&#8221; says he, explorin&#8217;
his vest pockets sort of aimless with his
fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s another good guess,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but
there&#8217;s lots of time ahead of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I am&mdash;well, never mind the name,&#8221; says
he, brushin&#8217; one hand over his eyes. &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ve
mislaid it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no matter,&#8221; says he, beginnin&#8217; to ramble
on again. &#8220;But I own a great deal of property
in the city, and my head has been troubling
me lately, and I heard you could help me. I&#8217;ll
pay you well, you know. I&mdash;I&#8217;ll give you the
Brooklyn Bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha-a-at&#8217;s that?&#8221; I gasps. &#8220;Say,
couldn&#8217;t you make it Madison Square Garden?
I could get rent out of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you prefer,&#8221; says he, without
crackin&#8217; a smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And this is Mr. Tutwater,&#8221; says I. &#8220;He
ought to be in on this. What&#8217;ll yours be,
Tutty?&#8221;</p>
<p>Say, for a minute or so I couldn&#8217;t make out
whether the old party was really off his chump
or what. He&#8217;s a well dressed, prosperous lookin&#8217;
gent, a good deal on the retired broker type,
and I didn&#8217;t know but he might be some friend
of Pyramid Gordon&#8217;s who&#8217;d strayed in here to
hand me a josh before signin&#8217; on for a course
of lessons.</p>
<p>Next thing we knew, though, he slumps down
in my desk chair, leans back comf&#8217;table, sighs
sort of contented, smiles a batty, foolish smile
at us, and then closes his eyes. Another second
and he&#8217;s snorin&#8217; away as peaceful as you
please.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, say!&#8221; says I to Tutwater. &#8220;What
do you think of that, now? Does he take this
for a free lodgin&#8217; house, or Central Park?
Looks like it was up to me to ring for the
wagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; says Tutwater. &#8220;The police handle
these cases so stupidly. His mind has been
affected, possibly from some shock, and he is
physically exhausted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all in, sure enough,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but I
can&#8217;t have him sawin&#8217; wood here. Come, come,
old scout,&#8221; I hollers in his ear, &#8220;you&#8217;ll have to
camp somewhere else for this act!&#8221; I might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
as well have shouted into the safe, though. He
never stirs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing to do,&#8221; says Tutwater, &#8220;is to
discover his name, if we can, and then communicate
with his friends or family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right, Tutwater,&#8221; says I.
&#8220;And there&#8217;s a bunch of letters in his inside
pocket. Have a look.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They all seem to be addressed to J. T.
Fargo, Esq.,&#8221; says Tutwater.</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Say, you don&#8217;t suppose
our sleepin&#8217; friend here is old Jerry Fargo,
do you? Look at the tailor&#8217;s label inside the
pocket. Eh? Jeremiah T. Fargo! Well, say,
Tutty, that wa&#8217;n&#8217;t such an idle dream of his,
about givin&#8217; me the garden. Guess he could if
he wanted to. Why, this old party owns more
business blocks in this town than anybody I
know of except the Astors. And I was for
havin&#8217; him carted off to the station! Lemme
see that &#8217;phone directory.&#8221;</p>
<p>A minute more and I had the Fargo house on
the wire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Oh, Mr. Fargo&#8217;s
butler. Well, this is Shorty McCabe, and I want
to talk to some of the fam&#8217;ly about the old man.
Sure, old Jerry. He&#8217;s here. Eh, his sister?
She&#8217;ll do. Yes, I&#8217;ll hold the wire.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d heard of that old maid sister of his, and
how she was a queer old girl; but I didn&#8217;t have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
any idea what a cold blooded proposition she
was. Honest, she seemed put out and pettish
because I&#8217;d called her up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeremiah again, hey?&#8221; she squeaks.
&#8220;Now, why on earth don&#8217;t he stay in that sanatorium
where I took him? This is the fourth
time he&#8217;s gone wandering off, and I&#8217;ve been sent
for to hunt him up. You just tell him to trot
back to it, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But see here, Miss Fargo,&#8221; says I, &#8220;he&#8217;s
been trottin&#8217; around until you can&#8217;t tell him anything!
He&#8217;s snoozin&#8217; away here in my office,
dead to the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t help it,&#8221; says she. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
going to be bothered with Jeremiah to-day. I&#8217;ve
got two sick cats to attend to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cats!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Say, what do you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hush up!&#8221; says she. &#8220;Do anything
you like with him!&#8221; And hanged if she don&#8217;t
bang up the receiver at that, and leave me
standin&#8217; there at my end of the wire lookin&#8217;
silly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk about your freak plutes,&#8221; says I to
Tutwater, after I&#8217;ve explained the situation,
&#8220;if this ain&#8217;t the limit! Look what I&#8217;ve got on
my hands now!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tutwater, he&#8217;s standin&#8217; there gazin&#8217; hard at
old Jerry Fargo, his eyes shinin&#8217; and his
thought works goin&#8217; at high pressure speed.
All of a sudden he slaps me on the back and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
grips me by the hand. &#8220;Professor,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;I have it! There is Opportunity!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Old Jerry? How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall cure him&mdash;restore his mind, make
him normal,&#8221; says Tutwater.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about brushin&#8217; out batty
lofts?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing at all,&#8221; says he; &#8220;but I can find
someone who does. You&#8217;ll give me Fargo,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will I?&#8221; says I. &#8220;I&#8217;ll advance you twenty
to take him away, and charge it up to him. But
what&#8217;ll you do with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Start the Tutwater Sanatorium for Deranged
Millionaires,&#8221; says he. &#8220;There&#8217;s a fortune
in it. May I leave him here for an hour
or so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until I can engage my chief of staff,&#8221; says
he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Tutty,&#8221; says I, &#8220;do you really mean
to put over a bluff the size of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought it all out,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I can
do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, blaze ahead,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but I&#8217;m
bettin&#8217; you land in the lockup inside of twenty-four
hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>What do you think, though? By three o&#8217;clock
he comes back, towin&#8217; a spruce, keen eyed
young chap that he introduces as Dr. McWade.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
He&#8217;s picked him up over at Bellevue, where he
found him doin&#8217; practice work in the psychopathic
ward. On the strength of that I doubles
my grubstake, and he no sooner gets his hands
on the two sawbucks than he starts for the
street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, here!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Where you headed
for now?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Tutwater explains how his first investment
is to be a new silk lid, some patent leather
shoes, and a silver headed walkin&#8217; stick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good business!&#8221; says I. &#8220;You&#8217;ll need all
the front you can carry.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while he&#8217;s out shoppin&#8217; the Doc and me
and Swifty Joe lugs the patient up to Tutwater&#8217;s
office without disturbin&#8217; his slumbers at
all.</p>
<p>Well, I didn&#8217;t see much more of Tutwater that
day, for from then on he was a mighty busy
man; but as I was drillin&#8217; across to the Grand
Central on my way home I gets a glimpse of
him, sportin&#8217; a shiny hat and white spats, just
rushin&#8217; important into a swell real estate office.
About noon next day he stops in long enough
to shake hands and say that it&#8217;s all settled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tutwater Sanatorium is a fact,&#8221; says he.
&#8220;I have the lease in my pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, some abandoned farm up in
Vermont?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; says Tutwater, smilin&#8217; quiet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Cragswoods; beautiful modern buildings,
formerly occupied as a boys&#8217; boarding school,
fifteen acres of lovely grounds, finest location
in Westchester County. We take possession
to-day, with our patient.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, say, Tutwater,&#8221; says I, &#8220;how in
blazes did you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I produced Fargo,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Dr. McWade
has him under complete control and his
cure has already begun. It will be finished at
Cragswoods. Run up and see us soon. There&#8217;s
the address. So long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, even after that, I couldn&#8217;t believe he&#8217;d
really pull it off. Course, I knew he could make
Fargo&#8217;s name go a long ways if he used it judicious;
but to launch out and hire an estate
worth half a million&mdash;why he was makin&#8217; a shoestring
start look like a sure thing.</p>
<p>And I was still listenin&#8217; for news of the grand
crash, when I begun seein&#8217; these items in the
papers about the Tutwater Sanatorium. &#8220;Millionaires
Building a Stone Wall,&#8221; one was
headed, and it went on to tell how five New York
plutes, all sufferin&#8217; from some nerve breakdown,
was gettin&#8217; back health and clearin&#8217; up their
brains by workin&#8217; like day laborers under the
direction of the famous specialist, Dr. Clinton
McWade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; says I. &#8220;He&#8217;s added a press agent
to the staff, and he sure has got a bird!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>Every few days there&#8217;s a new story bobs up,
better than the last, until I can&#8217;t stand it any
longer. I takes half a day off and goes up
there to see if he&#8217;s actually doin&#8217; it. And, say,
when I walks into the main office over the Persian
rug, there&#8217;s the same old Tutwater.
Course, he&#8217;s slicked up some fancy, and he&#8217;s
smokin&#8217; a good cigar; but you couldn&#8217;t improve
any on the cheerful countenance he used to
carry around, even when he was up against it
hardest. What I asks to see first is the five
millionaires at work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven, you mean,&#8221; says Tutwater. &#8220;Two
more came yesterday. Step right out this way.
There they are, seven; count &#8217;em, seven. The
eighth man is a practical stone mason who is
bossing the job. It&#8217;s a good stone wall they&#8217;re
building, too. We expect to run it along our
entire frontage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got &#8217;em mesmerized?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; says Tutwater. &#8220;It&#8217;s part of
the treatment. McWade&#8217;s idea, you know. The
vocational cure, we call it, and it works like a
charm. Mr. Fargo is practically a well man
now and could return to his home next week
if he wished. As it is, he&#8217;s so much interested
in finishing that first section of the wall that
he will probably stay the month out. You can
see for yourself what they are doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Seven of &#8217;em!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
What I don&#8217;t understand, Tutwater, is how you
got so many patients so soon. Where&#8217;d you get
hold of &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be quite frank with you, McCabe,&#8221; says
Tutwater, whisperin&#8217; confidential in my ear,
&#8220;only three of them are genuine paying patients.
That is why I have to charge them fifty
dollars a day, you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the others?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;First class imitations, who are playing
their parts very cleverly,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Why
not? I engaged them through a reliable theatrical
agency.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I. &#8220;You salted the sanatorium?
Tutwater, I take it all back. You&#8217;re in
the other class, and I&#8217;m backin&#8217; you after this
for whatever entry you want to make.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>HOW HERMY PUT IT OVER</h3>
</div>

<p>What do you know about luck, eh? Say, there
was a time when I banked heavy on such things
as four-leaf clovers, and the humpback touch,
and dodgin&#8217; ladders, and keepin&#8217; my fingers
crossed after gettin&#8217; an X-ray stare. The
longer I watch the game, though, the less I think
of the luck proposition as a chart for explainin&#8217;
why some gets in on the ground floor, while
others are dropped through the coal chute.</p>
<p>Now look at the latest returns on the career of
my old grammar school chum, Snick Butters.
Maybe you don&#8217;t remember my mentionin&#8217; him
before. Yes? No? It don&#8217;t matter. He&#8217;s the
sporty young gent that&#8217;s mortgaged his memorial
window to me so many times,&mdash;you know,
the phony lamp he can do such stunts with.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a smooth boy, Snick is,&mdash;too smooth, I
used to tell him,&mdash;and always full of schemes for
avoidin&#8217; real work. For a year or so past he&#8217;s
held the hot air chair on the front end of one
of these sightseein&#8217; chariots, cheerin&#8217; the out of
town buyers and wheat belt tourists with the
flippest line of skyscraper statistics handed out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
through any megaphone in town. They tell me
that when Snick would fix his fake eye on the
sidewalk, and roll the good one up at the Metropolitan
tower, he&#8217;d have his passengers so dizzy
they&#8217;d grab one another to keep from fallin&#8217;
off the wagon.</p>
<p>Yes, I always did find Snick&#8217;s comp&#8217;ny entertainin&#8217;,
and if it hadn&#8217;t been more or less expensive,&mdash;a
visit always meanin&#8217; a touch with
him,&mdash;I expect I&#8217;d been better posted on what
he was up to. As it is, I ain&#8217;t enjoyed the luxury
of seein&#8217; Snick for a good many months;
when here the other afternoon, just as I was
thinking of startin&#8217; for home, the studio door
opens, and in blows a couple of gents, one being
a stranger, and the other this Mr. Butters.</p>
<p>Now, usually Snick&#8217;s a fancy dresser, no matter
who he owes for it. He&#8217;ll quit eatin&#8217; any
time, or do the camel act, or even give up his
cigarettes; but if the gents&#8217; furnishing shops are
showin&#8217; something new in the line of violet
socks or alligator skin vests, Snick&#8217;s got to sport
the first ones sprung on Broadway.</p>
<p>So, seein&#8217; him show up with fringes on his
cuffs, a pair of runover tan shoes, and wearin&#8217;
his uniform cap off duty, I can&#8217;t help feelin&#8217;
some shocked, or wonderin&#8217; how much more&#8217;n
a five-spot I&#8217;ll be out by the time he leaves. It
was some relief, though, to see that the glass
eye was still in place, and know I wouldn&#8217;t be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
called on to redeem the ticket on that, anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Snick!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Glad you came
in,&mdash;I was just going. Hope you don&#8217;t mind
my lockin&#8217; the safe? No offense, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can it, Shorty,&#8221; says he. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
brace coming this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Once more with that last,
and say it slower, so I can let it sink in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t kid,&#8221; says he. &#8220;This is straight
business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Well, that does sound serious.
In that case, who&#8217;s your&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;Did he
come in with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought he did at first; but he seems so little
int&#8217;rested in either Snick or me that I wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
sure but he just wandered in because he saw
the door open. He&#8217;s a high, well built, fairly
good lookin&#8217; chap, dressed neat and quiet in
black; and if it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t for the sort of aimless,
wanderin&#8217; look in his eyes, you might have suspected
he was somebody in partic&#8217;lar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, him!&#8221; says Snick, shootin&#8217; a careless
glance over his shoulder. &#8220;Yes, of course he&#8217;s
with me. It&#8217;s him I want to talk to you about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says I, &#8220;don&#8217;t he&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;Is it a
dummy, or a live one? Got a name, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sure!&#8221; says Snick. &#8220;That&#8217;s Hermy.
Hey you, Hermy, shake hands with Professor
McCabe!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy,&#8221; says I, makin&#8217; ready to pass the
grip. But Hermy ain&#8217;t in a sociable mood, it
seems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, bother!&#8221; says he, lookin&#8217; around kind
of disgusted and not noticin&#8217; the welcomin&#8217;
hand at all. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to stay here. I
ought to be home, dressing for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>And say, that gives you about as much idea
of the way he said it, as you&#8217;d get of an oil
paintin&#8217; from seein&#8217; a blueprint. I can&#8217;t put in
the pettish shoulder wiggle that goes with it, or
make my voice behave like his did. It was the
most ladylike voice I ever heard come from a
heavyweight; one of these reg&#8217;lar &#8220;Oh-fudge-Lizzie-I-dropped-my-gum&#8221;
voices. And him
with a chest on him like a swell front mahog&#8217;ny
bureau!</p>
<p>&#8220;Splash!&#8221; says I. &#8220;You mean, mean thing!
So there!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind what he says at all, Shorty,&#8221;
says Snick. &#8220;You wait! I&#8217;ll fix him!&#8221; and
with that he walks up to Hermy, shakes his
finger under his nose, and proceeds to lay him
out. &#8220;Now what did I tell you; eh, Hermy?&#8221;
says Snick. &#8220;One lump of sugar in your tea&mdash;no
pie&mdash;and locked in your room at eight-thirty.
Oh, I mean it! You&#8217;re here to behave
yourself. Understand? Take your fingers off
that necktie! Don&#8217;t slouch against the wall
there, either! You might get your coat dusty.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
Dress for dinner! Didn&#8217;t I wait fifteen minutes
while you fussed with your hair? And do you
think you&#8217;re going to go through all that again?
You&#8217;re dressed for dinner, I tell you! But you
don&#8217;t get a bit unless you do as you&#8217;re told!
Hear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-e-es, sir,&#8221; sniffles Hermy.</p>
<p>Honest, it was a little the oddest exhibition
I ever saw. Why, he would make two of Snick,
this Hermy would, and he has a pair of shoulders
like a truck horse. Don&#8217;t ever talk to me
about chins again, either! Hermy has chin
enough for a trust buster; but that&#8217;s all the
good it seems to do him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t cast the hypnotic spell over him,
have you, Snick?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hypnotic nothing!&#8221; says Snick. &#8220;That
ain&#8217;t a man; it&#8217;s only a music box!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A which?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Barytone,&#8221; says Snick. &#8220;Say, did you
ever hear Bonci or Caruso or any of that mob
warble? No? Well, then I&#8217;ll have to tell you.
Look at Hermy there. Take a good long gaze
at him. And&mdash;sh-h-h! After he&#8217;s had one show
at the Metropolitan he&#8217;ll have that whole bunch
carryin&#8217; spears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this something you dreamed, Snick,&#8221;
says I, &#8220;or is it a sample of your megaphone
talk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe it, of course,&#8221; says he.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
&#8220;That&#8217;s what I brought him up here for.
Hermy, turn on the Toreador business!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; says I; then I sees Hermy gettin&#8217;
into position to cut loose. &#8220;Back up there!
Shut it off! What do I know about judgin&#8217; singers
on the hoof? Why, he might be all you say,
or as bad as I&#8217;d be willin&#8217; to bet; but I wouldn&#8217;t
know it. And what odds does it make to me,
one way or another?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, Shorty,&#8221; says Snick, earnest and
pleadin&#8217;; &#8220;but you&#8217;re my last hope. I&#8217;ve simply
got to convince you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, Snick,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but this ain&#8217;t my
day for tryin&#8217; out barytones. Besides, I got to
catch a train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; says Snick. &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll trot
along with you while I tell you about Hermy.
Honest, Shorty, you&#8217;ve got to hear it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s as desperate as all that,&#8221; says I,
&#8220;spiel away.&#8221;</p>
<p>And of all the plunges I ever knew Snick Butters
to make,&mdash;and he sure is the dead gamest
sport I ever ran across,&mdash;this one that he owns
up to takin&#8217; on Hermy had all his past performances
put in the piker class.</p>
<p>Accordin&#8217; to the way he deals it out, Snick
had first discovered Hermy about a year ago,
found him doin&#8217; the tray balancin&#8217; act in a
porcelain lined three-off-and-draw-one parlor
down on Seventh-ave. He was doin&#8217; it bad, too,&mdash;gettin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
the orders mixed, and spillin&#8217; soup on
the customers, and passin&#8217; out wrong checks,
and havin&#8217; the boss worked up to the assassination
point.</p>
<p>But Hermy didn&#8217;t even know enough to be
discouraged. He kept right on singsongin&#8217; out
his orders down the shaft, as cheerful as you
please: &#8220;Sausage and mashed, two on the
wheats, one piece of punk, and two mince, and
let &#8217;em come in a hurry! Silver!&#8221; You know
how they do it in them C. B. &amp; Q. places? Yes,
corned beef and cabbage joints. With sixty or
seventy people in a forty by twenty-five room,
and the dish washers slammin&#8217; crockery regardless,
you got to holler out if you want the chef
to hear. Hermy wa&#8217;n&#8217;t much on the shout, so
he sang his orders. And it was this that gave
Snick his pipedream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you know I&#8217;ve done more or less tra-la-la-work
myself,&#8221; says he, &#8220;and the season
I spent on the road as one of the merry villagers
with an Erminie outfit put me wise to a few
things. Course, this open air lecturing has
spoiled my pipes for fair; but I&#8217;ve got my ear
left, haven&#8217;t I? And say, Shorty, the minute
I heard that voice of Hermy&#8217;s I knew he was
the goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what does he do but go back later, after
the noon rush was over, and get Hermy to tell
him the story of his life. It wa&#8217;n&#8217;t what you&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
call thrillin&#8217;. All there was to it was that
Hermy was a double orphan who&#8217;d been brought
up in Bridgeport, Conn., by an uncle who was a
dancin&#8217; professor. The only thing that saved
Hermy from a bench in the brass works was his
knack for poundin&#8217; out twosteps and waltzes on
the piano; but at that it seems he was such
a soft head he couldn&#8217;t keep from watchin&#8217; the
girls on the floor and striking wrong notes.
Then there was trouble with uncle. Snick didn&#8217;t
get the full details of the row, or what brought
it to a head; but anyway Hermy was fired from
the academy and fin&#8217;lly drifted to New York,
where he&#8217;d been close up against the bread line
ever since.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when I found how he just naturally ate
up music,&#8221; says Snick, &#8220;and how he&#8217;d had
some training in a boy choir, and what a range
he had, I says to him, &#8216;Hermy,&#8217; says I, &#8216;you
come with me!&#8217; First I blows in ten good hard
dollars getting a lawyer to draw up a contract.
I thought it all out by myself; but I wanted the
whereases put in right. And it&#8217;s a peach. It
bound me to find board and lodging and provide
clothes and incidentals for Hermy for the period
of one year; and in consideration of which, and
all that, I am to be the manager and sole business
representative of said Hermy for the term
of fifteen years from date, entitled to a fair
and equal division of whatsoever profits, salary,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
or emoluments which may be received by the
party of the second part, payable to me, my
heirs, or assigns forever. And there I am,
Shorty. I&#8217;ve done it! And I&#8217;m going to stay
with it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; says I. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say
you&#8217;ve invested a year&#8217;s board and lodgin&#8217; and
expenses in&mdash;in that?&#8221; and I gazes once more
at this hundred and eighty-pound wrist slapper,
who is standin&#8217; there in front of the mirror
pattin&#8217; down a stray lock.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done,&#8221; says Snick, shovin&#8217;
his hands in his pockets and lookin&#8217; at the exhibit
like he was proud of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how the&mdash;where in blazes did you get
it?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Squeezed it out,&#8221; says Snick; &#8220;out of myself,
too. And you know me. I always was as
good to myself as other folks would let me. But
all that had to be changed. It come hard, I
admit, and it cost more&#8217;n I figured on. Why,
some of his voice culture lessons set me back
ten a throw. Think of that! He&#8217;s had &#8217;em,
though. And me? Well, I&#8217;ve lived on one meal
a day. I&#8217;ve done a double trick: on the wagon
day times, night cashier in a drug store from
nine till two a.m. I&#8217;ve cut out theaters, cigarettes,
and drinks. I&#8217;ve made my old clothes
last over, and I&#8217;ve pinched the dimes and nickels
so hard my thumbprints would look like treasury
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
dies. But we&#8217;ve got the goods, Shorty.
Hermy may be the mushiest, sappiest, hen
brained specimen of a man you ever saw; but
when it comes to being a high class grand opera
barytone, he&#8217;s the kid! And little Percival here
is his manager and has the power of attorney
that will fix him for keeps if I know anything!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-e-es?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Reminds me some of
the time when you was backin&#8217; Doughnut to
win the Suburban. Recollect how hard you
scraped to get the two-fifty you put down on
Doughnut at thirty to one, and how hard you
begged me to jump in and pull out a bale of
easy money? Let&#8217;s see; did the skate finish
tenth, or did he fall through the hole in his
name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, say!&#8221; says Snick. &#8220;Don&#8217;t go digging
that up now. That was sport. This is straight
business, on the level, and I ain&#8217;t asking you
to put up a cent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what then?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>Would you guess it? He wants me to book
Hermy for a private exhibition before some of
my swell friends! All I&#8217;ve got to do is to persuade
some of &#8217;em to give a little musicale, and
then spring this nutmeg wonder on the box
holdin&#8217; set without warnin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he was a Russki with long hair,&#8221; says I,
&#8220;or even a fiddlin&#8217; Czech, they might stand for
it; but to ask &#8217;em to listen to a domestic unknown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
from Bridgeport, Conn.&mdash;&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t
have the nerve, Snick. Why not take him
around to the concert agencies first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; says Snick. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t we worn out
the settees in the agency offices? What do they
know about good barytone voices? All they
judge by is press clippings and lists of past engagements.
Now, your people would know.
He&#8217;d have &#8217;em going in two minutes, and they&#8217;d
spread the news afterwards. Then we&#8217;d have
the agents coming to us. See?&#8221;</p>
<p>Course I couldn&#8217;t help gettin&#8217; int&#8217;rested in
this long shot of Snick&#8217;s, even if I don&#8217;t take
any stock in his judgment; but I tries to explain
that while I mix more or less with classy folks,
I don&#8217;t exactly keep their datebooks for &#8217;em, or
provide talent for their after dinner stunts.</p>
<p>That don&#8217;t head off Snick, though. He says
I&#8217;m the only link between him and the set he
wants to reach, and he just can&#8217;t take no for an
answer. He says he&#8217;ll depend on me for a date
for next Wednesday night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Wednesday?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t
Thursday or Friday do as well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says he. &#8220;That&#8217;s Frenchy&#8217;s only
night off from the café, and it&#8217;s his dress suit
Hermy&#8217;s got to wear. It&#8217;ll be some tight across
the back; but it&#8217;s the biggest one I can get the
loan of without paying rent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I tells Snick I&#8217;ll see what can be done,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
and when I gets home I puts the problem up
to Sadie. Maybe if she&#8217;d had a look at Hermy
she&#8217;d taken more interest; but as it is she says
she don&#8217;t see how I can afford to run the
chances of handin&#8217; out a lemon, even if there
was an op&#8217;nin&#8217;. Then again, so many of our
friends were at Palm Beach just now, and those
who&#8217;d come back were so busy givin&#8217; Lent
bridge parties, that the chances of workin&#8217; in
a dark horse barytone was mighty slim. She&#8217;d
think it over, though, and see if maybe something
can&#8217;t be done.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s the best I can give Snick when he
shows up in the mornin&#8217;, and it was the same
every day that week. I was kind of sorry for
Snick, and was almost on the point of luggin&#8217;
him and his discovery out to the house and
askin&#8217; in a few of the neighbors, when Sadie
tells me that the Purdy-Pells are back from
Florida and are goin&#8217; to open their town house
with some kind of happy jinks Wednesday night,
and that we&#8217;re invited.</p>
<p>Course, that knocks out my scheme. I&#8217;d
passed the sad news on to Snick; and it was
near noon Wednesday, when I&#8217;m called up on
the &#8217;phone by Sadie. Seems that Mrs. Purdy-Pell
had signed a lady harpist and a refined
monologue artist to fill in the gap between coffee
and bridge, and the lady harper had scratched
her entry on account of a bad case of grip. So
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
couldn&#8217;t I find my friend Mr. Butters and get
him to produce his singer? The case had been
stated to Mrs. Purdy-Pell, and she was willin&#8217;
to take the risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; says I. &#8220;But it&#8217;s all up to her,
don&#8217;t you forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that I chases down to Madison Square,
catches Snick just startin&#8217; out with a load of
neck stretchers, gives him the number, and tells
him to show up prompt at nine-thirty. And I
wish you could have seen the joy that spread
over his homely face. Even the store eye
seemed to be sparklin&#8217; brighter&#8217;n ever.</p>
<p>Was he there? Why, as we goes in to dinner
at eight o&#8217;clock, I catches sight of him and
Hermy holdin&#8217; down chairs in the reception
room. Well, you know how they pull off them
affairs. After they&#8217;ve stowed away about eleventeen
courses, from grapefruit and sherry to
demitasse and benedictine, them that can leave
the table without wheel chairs wanders out
into the front rooms, and the men light up fresh
perfectos and hunt for the smokin&#8217; den, and
the women get together in bunches and exchange
polite knocks. And in the midst of all that some
one drifts casually up to the concert grand and
cuts loose. That was about the programme in
this case.</p>
<p>Hermy was all primed for his cue, and when
Mrs. Purdy-Pell gives the nod I sees Snick push
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
him through the door, and in another minute
the thing is on. The waiter&#8217;s uniform was a
tight fit, all right; for it stretches across his
shoulders like a drumhead. And the shirt studs
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t mates, and the collar was one of them
saw edged laundry veterans. But the general
effect was good, and Hermy don&#8217;t seem to mind
them trifles at all. He stands up there lookin&#8217;
big and handsome, simpers and smiles around
the room a few times, giggles a few at the young
lady who&#8217;d volunteered to do the ivory punishing,
and then fin&#8217;lly he gets under way with the
Toreador song.</p>
<p>As I say, when it comes to gems from Carmen,
I&#8217;m no judge; but this stab of Hermy&#8217;s
strikes me from the start as a mighty good attempt.
He makes a smooth, easy get-away, and
he strikes a swingin&#8217;, steady gait at the quarter,
and when he comes to puttin&#8217; over the deep,
rollin&#8217; chest notes I has feelin&#8217;s down under
the first dinner layer like I&#8217;d swallowed a small
thunder storm. Honest, when he fairly got
down to business and hittin&#8217; it up in earnest, he
had me on my toes, and by the look on Sadie&#8217;s
face I knew that our friend Hermy was going
some.</p>
<p>But was all the others standin&#8217; around with
their mouths open, drinkin&#8217; it in? Anything
but! You see, some late comers had arrived,
and they&#8217;d brought bulletins of something rich
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
and juicy that had just happened in the alimony
crowd,&mdash;I expect the event will figure on the
court calendars later,&mdash;and they&#8217;re so busy passin&#8217;
on the details to willin&#8217; ears, that Hermy
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t disturbin&#8217; &#8217;em at all. As a matter of
fact, not one in ten of the bunch knew whether
he was makin&#8217; a noise like a bullfighter or a
line-up man.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help takin&#8217; a squint around at Snick,
who&#8217;s peekin&#8217; in through the draperies. And
say, he&#8217;s all but tearin&#8217; his hair. It was tough,
when you come to think of it. Here he&#8217;d put
his whole stack of blues on this performance,
and the audience wa&#8217;n&#8217;t payin&#8217; any more attention
to it than to the rattle of cabs on the
avenue.</p>
<p>Hermy has most got to the final spasm, and
it&#8217;s about all over, when, as a last straw, some
sort of disturbance breaks out in the front hall.
First off I thought it must be Snick Butters
throwin&#8217; a fit; but then I hears a voice that ain&#8217;t
his, and as I glances out I sees the Purdy-Pell
butler havin&#8217; a rough house argument with a
black whiskered gent in evenin&#8217; clothes and a
Paris model silk lid. Course, everyone hears
the rumpus, and there&#8217;s a grand rush, some to
get away, and others to see what&#8217;s doin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me in! I demand entrance! It must
be!&#8221; howls the gent, while the butler tries to
tell him he&#8217;s got to give up his card first.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>And next thing I know Snick has lit on the
butler&#8217;s back to pull him off, and the three are
havin&#8217; a fine mix-up, when Mr. Purdy-Pell comes
boltin&#8217; out, and I&#8217;ve just offered to bounce any
of &#8217;em that he&#8217;ll point out, when all of a sudden
he recognizes the party behind the brunette lambrequins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why,&#8221; says he, &#8220;what does this
mean, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon,&#8221; says the gent, puffin&#8217; and pushin&#8217;
to the front. &#8220;I intrude, yes? A thousand
pardons. But I will explain. Next door I am
dining&mdash;there is a window open&mdash;I hear that
wonderful voice. Ah! that marvelous voice!
Of what is the name of this artist? Yes? I
demand! I implore! Ah, I must know instantly,
sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, you know who it was. There&#8217;s only one
grand opera Napoleon with black whiskers who
does things in that way, and makes good every
trip. It&#8217;s him, all right. And if he don&#8217;t know
a barytone voice, who does?</p>
<p>Inside of four minutes him and Hermy and
Snick was bunched around the libr&#8217;y table, chewin&#8217;
over the terms of the contract, and next
season you&#8217;ll read the name of a new soloist in
letters four foot high.</p>
<p>Say, I was up to see Mr. Butters in his new
suite of rooms at the St. Swithin, where it never
rains but it pours. He&#8217;d held out for a big advance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
and he&#8217;d got it. Also he&#8217;d invested part
of it in some of the giddiest raiment them theatrical
clothing houses can supply. While a
manicure was busy puttin&#8217; a gloss finish on his
nails, he has his Mongolian valet display the
rest of his wardrobe, as far as he&#8217;d laid it in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I get let in wrong on the Hermy proposition,
eh?&#8221; says he. &#8220;How about stayin&#8217; with
your luck till it turns? Any reminder of the
Doughnut incident in this? What?&#8221;</p>
<p>Do I debate the subject? Not me! I just
slaps Snick on the back and wishes him joy.
If he wants to credit it all up to a rabbit&#8217;s foot,
or a clover leaf, I&#8217;m willin&#8217; to let him. But
say, from where I stand, it looks to me as if
nerve and grit played some part in it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>JOY RIDING WITH AUNTY</h3>
</div>

<p>Was I? Then I must have been thinking of
Dyke Mallory. And say, I don&#8217;t know how you
feel about it, but I figure that anybody who can
supply me with a hang-over grin good for three
days ain&#8217;t lived in vain. Whatever it&#8217;s worth,
I&#8217;m on his books for just that much.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit, too, that this Dyckman chap ain&#8217;t
apt to get many credits by the sweat of his
brow or the fag of his brain. There&#8217;s plenty
of folks would class him as so much plain nuisance,
and I have it from him that his own
fam&#8217;ly puts it even stronger. That&#8217;s one of his
specialties, confidin&#8217; to strangers how unpop&#8217;lar
he is at home. Why, he hadn&#8217;t been to the
studio more&#8217;n twice, and I&#8217;d just got next to the
fact that he was a son of Mr. Craig Mallory,
and was suggestin&#8217; a quarterly account for
him, when he gives me the warnin&#8217; signal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; says he. &#8220;I draw my allowance
the fifteenth, and unless you get it away from
me before the twentieth you might as well tear
up the bill. No use sending it to the pater,
either. He&#8217;d renig.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Handing you a few practical hints along the
economy line, eh?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse than that,&#8221; says Dyke. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
part of my penance for being the Great Disappointment.
The whole family is down on me.
Guess you don&#8217;t know about my Aunt Elvira?&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t, and there was no special reason why
I should; but before I can throw the switch
Dyke has got the deputy sheriff grip on the
Mallorys&#8217; private skeleton and is holdin&#8217; him up
and explainin&#8217; his anatomy.</p>
<p>Now, from all I&#8217;d ever seen or heard, I&#8217;d
always supposed Mr. Craig Mallory to be one
of the safety vault crowd. Course, they live
at Number 4 West; but that&#8217;s near enough to
the avenue for one of the old fam&#8217;lies. And
when you find a man who puts in his time as
chairman of regatta committees, and judgin&#8217;
hackneys, and actin&#8217; as vice president of a swell
club, you&#8217;re apt to rate him in the seven figure
bunch, at least. Accordin&#8217; to Duke, though, the
Mallory income needed as much stretchin&#8217; as
the pay of a twenty-dollar clothing clerk tryin&#8217;
to live in a thirty-five dollar flat. And this is
the burg where you can be as hard up on fifty
thousand a year as on five hundred!</p>
<p>The one thing the Mallorys had to look forward
to was the time when Aunt Elvira would
trade her sealskin sack for a robe of glory and
loosen up on her real estate. She was near
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
seventy, Aunty was, and when she first went
out to live at the old country place, up beyond
Fort George, it was a good half-day&#8217;s trip down
to 23d-st. But she went right on livin&#8217;, and
New York kept right on growin&#8217;, and now she
owns a cow pasture two blocks from a subway
station, and raises potatoes on land worth a
thousand dollars a front foot.</p>
<p>Bein&#8217; of different tastes and habits, her and
Brother Craig never got along together very
well, and there was years when each of &#8217;em tried
to forget that the other existed. When little
Dyckman came, though, the frost was melted.
She hadn&#8217;t paid any attention to the girls; but
a boy was diff&#8217;rent. Never havin&#8217; had a son
of her own to boss around and brag about, she
took it out on Dyke. A nice, pious old lady,
Aunt Elvira was; and the mere fact that little
Dyke seemed to fancy the taste of a morocco
covered New Testament she presented to him
on his third birthday settled his future in her
mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;He shall be a Bishop!&#8221; says she, and hints
that accordin&#8217; as Dyckman shows progress
along that line she intends loadin&#8217; him up with
worldly goods.</p>
<p>Up to the age of fifteen, Dyke gives a fair
imitation of a Bishop in the bud. He&#8217;s a light
haired, pleasant spoken youth, who stands well
with his Sunday school teacher and repeats passages
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
from the Psalms for Aunt Elvira when
she comes down to inflict her annual visit.</p>
<p>But from then on the bulletins wa&#8217;n&#8217;t so favor&#8217;ble.
At the diff&#8217;rent prep. schools where
he was tried out he appeared to be too much
of a live one to make much headway with the
dead languages. About the only subjects he led
his class in was hazing and football and buildin&#8217;
bonfires of the school furniture. Being expelled
got to be so common with him that towards the
last he didn&#8217;t stop to unpack his trunk.</p>
<p>Not that these harrowin&#8217; details was passed
on to Aunt Elvira. The Mallorys begun by
doctorin&#8217; the returns, and they developed into
reg&#8217;lar experts at the game of representin&#8217; to
Aunty what a sainted little fellow Dyke was
growin&#8217; to be. The more practice they got, the
harder their imaginations was worked; for by
the time Dyckman was strugglin&#8217; through his
last year at college he&#8217;d got to be such a full
blown hickey boy that he&#8217;d have been spotted
for a sport in a blind asylum.</p>
<p>So they had to invent one excuse after another
to keep Aunt Elvira from seein&#8217; him, all
the while givin&#8217; her tales about how he was soon
to break into the divinity school; hoping, of
course, that Aunty would get tired of waitin&#8217;
and begin to unbelt.</p>
<p>&#8220;They overdid it, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; says Dyke.
&#8220;Healthy looking Bishop I&#8217;d make! What?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t got just the style for a right
reverend, that&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>Which wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any wild statement of the case,
either. He&#8217;s a tall, loose jointed, slope shouldered
young gent, with a long, narrow face, gen&#8217;rally
ornamented by a cigarette; and he has his
straw colored hair cut plush. His costume is
neat but expensive,&mdash;double reefed trousers,
wide soled shoes, and a green yodler&#8217;s hat with
the bow on behind. He talks with the kind of
English accent they pick up at New Haven, and
when he&#8217;s in repose he tries to let on he&#8217;s so
bored with life that he&#8217;s in danger of fallin&#8217;
asleep any minute.</p>
<p>Judgin&#8217; from Dyke&#8217;s past performances,
though, there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t many somnolent hours in
it. But in spite of all the trouble he&#8217;d got into,
I couldn&#8217;t figure him out as anything more&#8217;n
playful. Course, rough housin&#8217; in rathskellers
until they called out the reserves, and turnin&#8217;
the fire hose on a vaudeville artist from a box,
and runnin&#8217; wild with a captured trolley car
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t what you might call innocent boyishness;
but, after all, there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t anything real vicious
about Dyke.</p>
<p>Playful states it. Give him a high powered
tourin&#8217; car, with a bunch of eight or nine from
the football squad aboard, and he liked to tear
around the State of Connecticut burnin&#8217; the
midnight gasolene and lullin&#8217; the villagers to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
sleep with the Boula-Boula song. Perfectly
harmless fun&mdash;if the highways was kept clear.
All the frat crowd said he was a good fellow,
and it was a shame to bar him out from takin&#8217;
a degree just on account of his layin&#8217; down on
a few exams. But that&#8217;s what the faculty did,
and the folks at home was wild.</p>
<p>Dyke had been back and on the unclassified
list for nearly a year now, and the prospects
of his breakin&#8217; into the divinity school was
growin&#8217; worse every day. He&#8217;d jollied Mr.
Mallory into lettin&#8217; him have a little two-cylinder
roadster, and his only real pleasure
in life was when he could load a few old grads
on the runnin&#8217; board and go off for a joy ride.</p>
<p>But after the old man had spent the cost of
a new machine in police court fines and repairs,
even this little diversion was yanked away. The
last broken axle had done the business, and the
nearest Dyke could come to real enjoyment was
when he had the price to charter a pink taxi
and inspire the chauffeur with highballs enough
so he&#8217;d throw her wide open on the way back.</p>
<p>Not bein&#8217; responsible for Dyke, I didn&#8217;t mind
having him around. I kind of enjoyed the cheerful
way he had of tellin&#8217; about the fam&#8217;ly boycott
on him, and every time I thinks of Aunt
Elvira still havin&#8217; him framed up for a comer
in the Bishop class, I has to smile.</p>
<p>You see, having gone so far with their fairy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
tales, the Mallorys never got a chance to hedge;
and, accordin&#8217; to Dyke, they was all scared stiff
for fear she&#8217;d dig up the facts some day, and
make a new will leavin&#8217; her rentroll to the foreign
missions society.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because I took more or less
interest in him, but perhaps it was just because
he wanted company and I happened to be handy;
anyway, here the other afternoon Dyke comes
poundin&#8217; up the stairs two at a time, rushes
into the front office, and grabs me by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Shorty!&#8221; says he. &#8220;Something
fruity is on the schedule.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope it don&#8217;t taste like a lemon,&#8221; says I.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the grand rush?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Elvira is coming down, and she&#8217;s
called for me,&#8221; says Dyke, grinnin&#8217; wide.
&#8220;She must suspect something; for she sent
word that if I wasn&#8217;t on hand this time she&#8217;d
never come again. What do you think of
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunty&#8217;s got a treat in store for her, eh?&#8221;
says I, givin&#8217; Dyke the wink.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should gurgle!&#8221; says he. &#8220;I&#8217;m good and
tired of this fake Bishop business, and if I don&#8217;t
jolt the old lady out of that nonsense, I&#8217;m a
duffer. You can help some, I guess. Come
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I didn&#8217;t exactly like the idea of mixin&#8217;
up with a fam&#8217;ly surprise party like that; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
Dyke is so anxious for me to go along, and he
gets me so curious to see what&#8217;ll happen at the
reunion, that I fin&#8217;lly grabs my coat and hat,
and out we trails.</p>
<p>It seems that Aunt Elvira is due at the Grand
Central. Never having tried the subway, she&#8217;s
come to town just as she used to thirty years
ago: drivin&#8217; to Kingsbridge station, and takin&#8217;
a Harlem river local down. We finds the whole
fam&#8217;ly, includin&#8217; Mr. and Mrs. Craig Mallory,
and their two married daughters, waitin&#8217; outside
the gates, with the gloom about &#8217;em so
thick you&#8217;d almost think it was a sea turn.</p>
<p>From the chilly looks they shot at Dyke you
could tell just how they&#8217;d forecasted the result
when Aunt Elvira got him all sized up; for,
with his collar turned up and his green hat
slouched, he looks as much like a divinity student
as a bulldog looks like Mary&#8217;s lamb. And
they can almost see them blocks of apartment
houses bein&#8217; handed over to the heathen.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Craig Mallory, he never so much
as gives his only son a second glance, but turns
his back and stands there, twistin&#8217; the ends of
his close cropped gray mustache, and tryin&#8217; to
look like he wa&#8217;n&#8217;t concerned at all. Good old
sport, Craig,&mdash;one of the kind that can sit behind
a pair of sevens and raise the opener out
of his socks. Lucky for his nerves he didn&#8217;t
have to wait long. Pretty soon in pulls the
train, and the folks from Yonkers and Tarrytown
begin to file past.</p>

&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Most of Auntie was obscured by the luggage she carries</span>&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;There she is!&#8221; whispers Dyke, givin&#8217; me
the nudge. &#8220;That&#8217;s Aunt Elvira, with her bonnet
on one ear.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of the few black velvet lids of the
1869 model still in captivity, ornamented with
a bunch of indigo tinted violets, and kept from
bein&#8217; lost off altogether by purple strings tied
under the chin. Most of the rest of Aunty was
obscured by the hand luggage she carries, which
includes four assorted parcels done up in wrappin&#8217;
paper, and a big, brass wire cage holdin&#8217;
a ragged lookin&#8217; gray parrot that was tryin&#8217; to
stick his bill through the bars and sample the
passersby.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s a wrinkled faced, but well colored and
hearty lookin&#8217; old girl, and the eyes that peeks
out under the rim of the velvet lid is as keen
and shrewd as a squirrel&#8217;s. Whatever else she
might be, it was plain Aunt Elvira wa&#8217;n&#8217;t feeble
minded. Behind her comes a couple of station
porters, one cartin&#8217; an old-time black valise, and
the other with his arms wrapped around a full
sized featherbed in a blue and white tick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Aunty carries her own
scenery with her, don&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Bismarck in the cage,&#8221; says Dyke.</p>
<p>&#8220;How Bizzy has changed!&#8221; says I. &#8220;But
why the feather mattress?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t sleep on anything else,&#8221; says he.
&#8220;Watch how pleased my sisters look. They
just love this&mdash;not! But she insists on having
the whole family here to meet her.&#8221;</p>
<p>I must say for Mr. Mallory that he stood it
well, a heavy swell like him givin&#8217; the glad hand
in public to a quaint old freak like that. But
Aunt Elvira don&#8217;t waste much time swappin&#8217;
fam&#8217;ly greetin&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Dyckman?&#8221; says she, settin&#8217; her
chin for trouble. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; says Mr. Mallory. &#8220;Right over
there,&#8221; and he points his cane handle to where
Dyke and me are grouped on the side lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, hold Bismarck!&#8221; says Aunty, jammin&#8217;
the brass cage into Mr. Mallory&#8217;s arm, and
with that she pikes straight over to us. I never
mistrusted she&#8217;d be in any doubt as to which
was which, until I sees her look from one to
the other, kind of waverin&#8217;. No wonder,
though; for, from the descriptions she&#8217;d had,
neither of us came up to the divinity student
specifications. Yet it was something of a shock
when she fixes them sharp old lamps on me
and says:</p>
<p>&#8220;Land to goodness! You?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reverse!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Here&#8217;s the guilty
party,&#8221; and I pushes Dyke to the front.</p>
<p>She don&#8217;t gasp, or go up in the air, or throw
any kind of a fit, like I expected. As she looks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
him over careful, from the sporty hat to the wide
soled shoes, I notices her eyes twinkle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum! I thought as much!&#8221; says she.
&#8220;Craig always could lie easier than he could
tell the truth. Young man, you don&#8217;t look to
me like a person called to hold orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad of it, Aunty,&#8221; says Dyke, with a grin.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t look as if you had broken
down your health studying for the ministry,
either!&#8221; she goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say they filled you up
with that?&#8221; says Dyke. &#8220;Hee-haw!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; says Aunty. &#8220;It&#8217;s a joke, is it?
At least you&#8217;re not afraid to tell the truth. I
guess I want to have a little private talk with
you. Who&#8217;s this other young man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Professor McCabe,&#8221; says Dyke.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a friend of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him come along, too,&#8221; says Aunty.
&#8220;Perhaps he can supply what you leave
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, say, the old girl knew what she wanted
and when she wanted it, all right! There was
no bunkoin&#8217; her out of it, either. Mr. Mallory
leads her out to his brougham and does his best
to shoo her in with him and Mrs. Mallory and
away from Dyke; but it was no go.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will ride up with Dyckman and his
friend,&#8221; says she. &#8220;And I want to go in one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
of those new automobile cabs I&#8217;ve heard so much
about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! We&#8217;ll get one, Aunty,&#8221; says Dyke,
and then he whispers in my ear, &#8220;Slip around
the corner and call for Jerry Powers. Number
439. He can make a taxi take hurdles and water
jumps.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether it was luck or not, but
Jerry was on the stand with the tin flag up,
and inside of two minutes the three of us was
stowed away inside, with the bag on top, and
Dyke holdin&#8217; Bismarck in his lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now my featherbed,&#8221; says Aunt Elvira,
and she has the porter jam it in alongside of
me, which makes more or less of a full house.
Then the procession starts, our taxi in the lead,
the brougham second, and the married sisters
trailin&#8217; behind in a hansom.</p>
<p>&#8220;My sakes! but these things do ride easy!&#8221;
says Aunty, settlin&#8217; back in her corner. &#8220;Can
they go any faster, Dyckman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wait until we get straightened out on
the avenue,&#8221; says Dyke, and tips me the roguish
glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve ridden behind some fast horses in my
time,&#8221; says the old lady; &#8220;so you can&#8217;t scare
me. But now, Dyckman, I&#8217;d like to know exactly
what you&#8217;ve been doing, and what you intend
to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Dyke starts in to unload the whole yarn,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
beginnin&#8217; by ownin&#8217; up that he&#8217;d scratched the
Bishop proposition long ago. And he was
statin&#8217; some of his troubles at college, when I
gets a backward glimpse out of the side window
at something that makes me sit up. First
off I thought it was another snow storm with
flakes bigger&#8217;n I&#8217;d ever seen before, and then I
tumbles to the situation. It ain&#8217;t snow; it&#8217;s
feathers. In jammin&#8217; that mattress into the
taxi the tick must have had a hole ripped in it,
and the part that was bulgin&#8217; through the opposite
window was leakin&#8217; hen foliage to beat the
cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221; says I, buttin&#8217; in on the confession
and pointin&#8217; back. &#8220;We&#8217;re losin&#8217; part of our
cargo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Land sakes!&#8221; says Aunt Elvira, after one
glance. &#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221;</p>
<p>At that Dyke pounds on the front glass for
the driver to shut off the juice. But Jerry must
have had Dyke out before, and maybe he mistook
the signal. Anyway, the machine gives a
groan and a jerk and we begins skimmin&#8217; along
the asphalt at double speed. That don&#8217;t check
the moltin&#8217; process any, and Dyke was gettin&#8217;
real excited, when we hears a chuckle from Aunt
Elvira.</p>
<p>The old girl has got her eyes trained through
the back window. Thanks to our speed and
the stiff wind that&#8217;s blowin&#8217; down the avenue,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
the Mallory brougham, with the horses on the
jump to keep up with us, is gettin&#8217; the full
benefit of the feather storm. The dark green
uniforms of the Mallory coachman and footman
was being plastered thick, and they was both
spittin&#8217; out feathers as fast as they could, and
the Mallorys was wipin&#8217; &#8217;em out of their eyes
and ears, and the crowds on the sidewalk has
caught on and is enjoyin&#8217; the performance, and
a mounted cop was starin&#8217; at us kind of puzzled,
as if he was tryin&#8217; to decide whether or not we
was breakin&#8217; an ordinance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at Craig! Look at Mabel Ann!&#8221;
snickers Aunt Elvira. &#8220;Tell your man to go
faster, Dyckman. Push out more feathers!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More feathers it is,&#8221; says I, shovin&#8217; another
fold of the bed through the window. Even Bismarck
gets excited and starts squawkin&#8217;.</p>
<p>Talk about your joy rides! I&#8217;ll bet that&#8217;s the
only one of the kind ever pulled off on Fifth-ave.
And it near tickles the old girl to death.
What was a featherbed to her, when she had
her sportin&#8217; blood up and was gettin&#8217; a hunch
in on Brother Craig and his wife?</p>
<p>We goes four blocks before we shakes out the
last of our ammunition, and by that time the
Mallory brougham looks like a poultry wagon
after a busy day at the market, while Aunt Elvira
has cut loose with the mirth so hard that
the velvet bonnet is hangin&#8217; under her chin, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
Bismarck is out of breath. It&#8217;s a wonder we
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t pinched for breakin&#8217; the speed laws; but
the traffic cops is so busy watchin&#8217; the feather
blizzard that they forgets to hold us up. Dyke
wants to know if I&#8217;ll come in for a cup of tea,
or ride back with Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, but I&#8217;ll walk back,&#8221; says I, as we
pulls up at the house. &#8220;Guess I can find the
trail easy enough, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>I s&#8217;posed I&#8217;d get a report of the reunion from
him next day; but it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t until this mornin&#8217;
that he shows up here and drags me down to
the curb to look at his new sixty-horse-power
macadam burner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Birthday present from Aunty,&#8221; says he.
&#8220;Say, she&#8217;s all to the good, Shorty. She got
over that Bishop idea months ago, all by herself.
And what do you think? She says I&#8217;m to
have a thousand a month, just to enjoy myself
on. Whe-e-e! Can I do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do it, son,&#8221; says I. &#8220;If you can&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t
know who can.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>TURNING A TRICK FOR BEANY</h3>
</div>

<p>Where&#8217;d I collect the Flemish oak tint on muh
noble br-r-r-ow? No, not sunnin&#8217; myself down
to Coney Island. No such tinhorn stunt for me!
This is the real plute color, this is, and I laid
it on durin&#8217; a little bubble tour we&#8217;d been takin&#8217;
through the breakfast doughnut zone.</p>
<p>It was Pinckney&#8217;s blow. He ain&#8217;t had the
gasolene-burnin&#8217; fever very hard until this summer;
but when he does get it, he goes the limit,
as usual. Course, he&#8217;s been off on excursions
with his friends, and occasionally he&#8217;s chartered
a machine by the day; but I&#8217;d never heard him
talk of wantin&#8217; to own one. And then the first
thing I knows he shows up at the house last
Monday night in the tonneau of one of these big
seven-seater road destroyers, all fitted out complete
with spare shoes, hat box, and a double-decker
trunk strapped on the rack behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you buy a
private railroad train while you was about it,
Pinckney?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely what I thought I was getting,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
says he. &#8220;However, I want you and Sadie to
help me test it. We&#8217;ll start to-morrow morning
at nine-thirty. Be all ready, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got any idea where you&#8217;re going, or how
long you&#8217;ll be gone?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing very definite,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Purdy-Pell
suggested the shore road to Boston and
back through the Berkshires.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; says I. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to go meanderin&#8217;
through the country with you from now until
Christmas; but sad to say I&#8217;ve got one or
two&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Renée tells me we can make it in four
days,&#8221; says Pinckney, nodding at the chauffeur.
&#8220;He&#8217;s been over the route a dozen times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I puts the proposition up to Sadie, expectin&#8217;
she&#8217;d queer it first jump; but inside of
ten minutes she&#8217;d planned out just how she
could leave little Sully, and what she should
wear, and it&#8217;s all fixed. I tried to show her
where I couldn&#8217;t afford to quit the studio for
two or three weeks, just at this time of year,
when so many of my reg&#8217;lars need tunin&#8217; up
after their vacations; but my arguments don&#8217;t
carry much weight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rubbish, Shorty!&#8221; says she. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be
back before the end of the week, and Swifty Joe
can manage until then. Anyway, we&#8217;re not going
to miss this lovely weather. We&#8217;re going,
that&#8217;s all!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; says I to Pinckney, &#8220;I&#8217;ve decided
to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now this ain&#8217;t any lightnin&#8217; conductor rehash.
Bubble tourin&#8217; has its good points, and it has
its drawbacks, too. If you&#8217;re willin&#8217; to take
things as they come along, and you&#8217;re travelin&#8217;
with the right bunch, and your own disposition&#8217;s
fair to middlin&#8217;, why, you can have a bang up
time, just like you could anywhere with the same
layout. Also, I&#8217;m willin&#8217; to risk an encore to
this partic&#8217;lar trip any time I get the chance.</p>
<p>But there was something else I was gettin&#8217; at.
It don&#8217;t turn up until along durin&#8217; the afternoon
of our second day out. We was tearin&#8217;
along one of them new tar roads between Narragansett
Pier and Newport, and I was tryin&#8217;
to hand a josh to Renée by askin&#8217; him to be sure
and tell me when we went through Rhode Island,
as I wanted to take a glance at it,&mdash;for we must
have been hittin&#8217; fifty an hour, with the engine
runnin&#8217; as smooth and sweet as a French clock,&mdash;when
all of a sudden there&#8217;s a bang like
bustin&#8217; a paper bag, and we feels the car sag
down on one side.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Sacré!</i>&#8221; says Renée through his front
teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, ha!&#8221; sings out Pinckney. &#8220;My first
blow-out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad you feel so happy over it,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a sensation that don&#8217;t bring much joy, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
a rule. Here you are, skimmin&#8217; along through
the country, glancin&#8217; at things sort of casual,
same&#8217;s you do from a Pullman window, but not
takin&#8217; any int&#8217;rest in the scenery except in a
general way, only wonderin&#8217; now and then how
it is people happen to live in places so far away.</p>
<p>And then all in a minute the scenery ain&#8217;t
movin&#8217; past you at all. It stops dead in its
tracks, like when the film of a movin&#8217; picture
machine gets tangled up, and there&#8217;s only one
partic&#8217;lar scene to look at. It&#8217;s mighty curious,
too, how quick that special spot loses its charm.
Also, as a gen&#8217;ral rule, such things happen just
at the wrong spot in the road. Now we&#8217;d been
sailin&#8217; along over a ridge, where we could look
out across Narragansett Bay for miles; but here
where our tire had gone on the blink was a kind
of dip down between the hills, with no view
at all.</p>
<p>First off we all has to pile out and get in
Renée&#8217;s way while he inspects the damage. It&#8217;s
a blow-out for fair, a hole big enough to lay
your two hands in, right across the tread, where
we&#8217;d picked up a broken bottle, or maybe a cast
horseshoe with the nails in it. Then, while he
proceeds to get busy with the jack and tire irons,
we all makes up our minds to a good long wait;
for when you tackle one of them big boys, with
the rims rusted in, it ain&#8217;t any fifteen-minute
picnic, you know.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>Course, Pinckney gets out his fireless bottles
and the glasses and improves the time by
handin&#8217; around somethin&#8217; soothin&#8217; or cheerin&#8217;,
accordin&#8217; to taste. Not bein&#8217; thirsty, I begins
inspectin&#8217; the contagious scenery. It wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
anything an artist would yearn to paint. Just
back from the road is a sort of shack that looks
as though someone might be campin&#8217; out in it,
and behind that a mess of rough sheds and
chicken coops.</p>
<p>Next I discovers that the object down in the
field which I&#8217;d taken for a scarecrow was a live
man. By the motions he&#8217;s goin&#8217; through, he&#8217;s
diggin&#8217; potatoes, and from the way he sticks
to it, not payin&#8217; any attention to us, it seems
as if he found it a mighty int&#8217;restin&#8217; pastime.
You&#8217;d most think, livin&#8217; in an out of the way,
forsaken place like that, that most any native
would be glad to stop work long enough to look
over a hot lookin&#8217; bunch like ours.</p>
<p>This one don&#8217;t seem inclined that way, though.
He keeps his back bent and his head down
and his hands busy. Now, whenever I&#8217;ve
been out in a machine, and we&#8217;ve had any kind
of trouble, there&#8217;s always been a gawpin&#8217; committee
standin&#8217; around, composed of every human
being in sight at the time of the casualty,
includin&#8217; a few that seemed to pop up out of
the ground. But here&#8217;s a case where the only
party that can act as an audience ain&#8217;t doin&#8217; his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
duty. So a fool freak hits me to stroll over and
poke him up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, you!&#8221; says I, vaultin&#8217; the fence.</p>
<p>He jerks his head up a little at that, kind of
stares in my direction, and then dives into another
hill of spuds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; thinks I. &#8220;Don&#8217;t want any city
folks in his&#8217;n, by chowder! But here&#8217;s where
he gets &#8217;em thrust on him!&#8221; and I pikes over
for a closer view. Couldn&#8217;t see much, though,
but dirty overalls, blue outing shirt, and an old
haymaker&#8217;s straw hat with a brim that lops
down around his face and ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; says I; &#8220;but ain&#8217;t you missin&#8217;
a trick, or is it because you don&#8217;t feel sociable
to-day? How&#8217;re the murphies pannin&#8217; out this
season?&#8221;</p>
<p>To see the start he gives, you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d crept
up from behind and swatted him one. He
straightens up, backs off a step or two, and
opens his mouth. &#8220;Why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; says he,
after one or two gasps. &#8220;Who are you,
please?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; says I. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m just a stray
stranger. I was being shot through your cunnin&#8217;
little State on a no-stop schedule, when one
of our tires went out of business. Hence this
informal call.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; says he, hesitatin&#8217; and pushin&#8217; back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
the hat brim, &#8220;isn&#8217;t this&mdash;er&mdash;aren&#8217;t you Professor
McCabe?&#8221;</p>
<p>Say, then it was my turn to do the open face
act! Course, knockin&#8217; around as much as I have
and rubbin&#8217; against so many diff&#8217;rent kinds of
folks, I&#8217;m liable to run across people that know
me anywhere; but blamed if I expected to do it
just walkin&#8217; out accidental into a potato
orchard.</p>
<p>Sure enough, too, there was something familiar
about that long thin nose and the droopy
mouth corners; but I couldn&#8217;t place him. Specially
I&#8217;d been willin&#8217; to pass my oath I&#8217;d never
known any party that owned such a scatterin&#8217;
crop of bleached face herbage as he was sportin&#8217;.
It looked like bunches of old hay on the
side of a hill. The stary, faded out blue eyes
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t just like any I could remember, either,
and I&#8217;m gen&#8217;rally strong on that point.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve called my number, all right,&#8221; says
I; &#8220;but, as for returnin&#8217; the compliment,
you&#8217;ve got me going, neighbor. How do you
think I&#8217;m looking?&#8221;</p>
<p>He makes a weak stab at springin&#8217; a smile,
about the ghastliest attempt at that sort of
thing I ever watched, and then he shrugs his
shoulders. &#8220;I&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t say about your
looks,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I recognized you by your
voice. Perhaps you won&#8217;t remember me at
all. I&#8217;m Dexter Bean.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; says I. &#8220;Not Beany, that used
to do architectin&#8217; on the top floor over the
studio?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve forgot my mug so soon?&#8221;
says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; says he, speakin&#8217; up quick. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t forgotten. But I can&#8217;t see very well
now, you know. In fact, I&mdash;I&#8217;m&mdash;&mdash; Well,
it&#8217;s almost night time with me, Shorty,&#8221; and
by the way he chokes up I can tell how hard it
is for him to get out even that much.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean,&#8221; says I, &#8220;that&mdash;that
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He nods, puts his hands up to his face, and
turns his head for a minute.</p>
<p>Well, say, I&#8217;ve had lumps come in my throat
once in a while before on some account or other;
but I never felt so much like I&#8217;d swallowed a
prize punkin as I did just then. Most night
time! Course, you hear of lots of cases, and
you know there&#8217;s asylums where such people
are taken care of and taught to weave cane bottoms
for chairs; but I tell you when you get
right up against such a case, a party you&#8217;ve
known and liked, and it&#8217;s handed to you sudden
that he&#8217;s almost in the stick tappin&#8217; class&mdash;well,
it&#8217;s apt to get you hard. I know it did
me. Why, I didn&#8217;t know any more what to do
or say than a goat. But it was my next.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, Beany, old boy!&#8221; says I, slidin&#8217;
an arm across his shoulder. &#8220;This is all news
to me. Let&#8217;s get over in the shade and talk
this thing over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;d like to, Shorty,&#8221; says he.</p>
<p>So we camps down under a tree next to the
fence, and he gives me the story. As he talks,
too, it all comes back to me about the first time
some of them boys from up stairs towed him
down to the studio. He&#8217;d drifted in from some
Down East crossroads, where he&#8217;d taken a
course in mechanical drawin&#8217; and got the idea
that he was an architect. And a greener Rube
than him I never expect to see. It was a wonder
some milliner hadn&#8217;t grabbed him and
sewed him on a hat before he got to 42d-st.</p>
<p>Maybe that gang of T Square sports didn&#8217;t
find him entertainin&#8217;, too. Why, he swallowed
all the moldy old bunk yarns they passed over,
and when they couldn&#8217;t hold in any longer, and
just let loose the hee-haws, he took it good
natured, springin&#8217; that kind of sad smile of his
on &#8217;em, and not even gettin&#8217; red around the
ears. So the boss set him to sweepin&#8217; the
floors and tendin&#8217; the blueprint frames on the
roof.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the way he broke in. Then a few
months later, when they had a rush of contracts,
they tried him out on some detail work.
But his drawin&#8217; was too ragged. He was so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
good natured, though, and so willin&#8217; to do anything
for anybody, that they kept him around,
mainly to spring new gags on, so far as I
could see.</p>
<p>It wa&#8217;n&#8217;t until he got at some house plans
by accident that they found out where he fitted
in. He&#8217;d go over a set of them puzzle rolls
that mean as much to me as a laundry ticket,
and he&#8217;d point out where there was room for
another clothes closet off some chamber here,
and a laundry chute there, and how the sink in
the butler&#8217;s pantry was on the wrong side for a
right handed dish washer, and a lot of little
details that nobody else would think of unless
they&#8217;d lived in just such a house for six months
or so. Beany the Home Expert, they called him
after that, and before any house plans was
O. K.&#8217;d by the boss he had to revise &#8217;em.</p>
<p>Then he got to hangin&#8217; round the studio after
hours, helpin&#8217; Swifty Joe clean up and listenin&#8217;
to his enlightenin&#8217; conversation. It takes a
mighty talented listener to get Swifty started;
but when he does get his tongue once limbered
up, and is sure of his audience, he enjoys nothin&#8217;
like givin&#8217; off his views in wholesale lots.</p>
<p>As for me, I never said a whole lot to Beany,
nor him to me; but I couldn&#8217;t help growin&#8217; to
like the cuss, because he was one of them gentle,
quiet kind that you cotton to without knowin&#8217;
exactly why. Not that I missed him a lot when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
he disappeared. Fact was, he just dropped out,
and I don&#8217;t know as I even asked what had become
of him.</p>
<p>I was hearin&#8217; now, though. It wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any
great tragedy, to start with. Some of the boys
got skylarkin&#8217; one lunch hour, and Beany was
watchin&#8217; &#8217;em, when a lead paper weight he was
holdin&#8217; slipped out of his hand, struck the end
of a ruler, and flipped it up into his face. A
sharp corner hit him in the eye, that&#8217;s all. He
had the sore peeper bound up for three or four
days before he took it to a hospital.</p>
<p>When he didn&#8217;t show up again they wondered
some, and one of the firm inquired for him at his
old boardin&#8217; place. You know how it is in town.
There&#8217;s so many comin&#8217; and goin&#8217; that it&#8217;s hard
to keep track of &#8217;em all. So Beany just faded
out.</p>
<p>He told me that when the hospital doctor put
it to him flat how bad off his bum lamp was, and
how the other was due to go the same way, he
just started out and walked aimless for two
days and nights, hardly stoppin&#8217;. Then he
steadied down, pulled himself together, and
mapped out a plan.</p>
<p>Besides architectin&#8217;, all he knew how to do
was to raise chickens. He figured that if he
could get a little place off where land was cheap,
and get the hang of it well in his head before
his glim was doused altogether, he might worry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
along. He couldn&#8217;t bear to think of goin&#8217; back
to his old home, or hangin&#8217; around among
strangers until he had to be herded into one of
them big brick barracks. He wanted to be alone
and outdoors.</p>
<p>He had a few dollars with him that he&#8217;d saved
up, and when he struck this little sand plot,
miles from anywhere, he squat right down on
it, built his shack, got some settin&#8217; hens, and
prepared for a long siege in the dark. One eye
was all to the bad already, and the other was
beginnin&#8217; to grow dim. Nice cheerful proposition
to wake up to every mornin&#8217;, wa&#8217;n&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Does Beany whine any in tellin&#8217; it, though?
Never a whimper! Gets off his little jokes on
himself about the breaks he makes cookin&#8217; his
meals, such as sweetenin&#8217; his coffee out of the
salt bag, and bitin&#8217; into a cake of bar soap,
thinkin&#8217; it was a slice of the soggy bread he&#8217;d
make. Keeps his courage up, too, by trying to
think that maybe livin&#8217; outdoors and improvin&#8217;
his health will help him get back his sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I am some better already,&#8221; says
he. &#8220;For months all I could see out of my left
eye was purple and yellow and blue rings. Now
I don&#8217;t see those at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That so?&#8221; says I, battin&#8217; my head for some
come-back that would fit. &#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;I should
think you&#8217;d miss &#8217;em, Beany.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brilliant, wa&#8217;n&#8217;t it? But Beany throws back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
his head and lets out the first real laugh he&#8217;s
indulged in for over a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, hardly that,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care
about carrying my rainbows around with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But look here, Beany,&#8221; says I. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t stay here doin&#8217; the poultry hermit act.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only thing I&#8217;m fit for,&#8221; says he;
&#8220;so I must.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve got to let us send you a few
things occasionally,&#8221; says I. &#8220;I&#8217;ll look up
your old boss and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; says he. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting along
all right. I&#8217;ve been a little lonesome; but I&#8217;ll
pull through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to be doin&#8217; some doctorin&#8217;,
though,&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>He shrugs his shoulders again and waves one
hand. &#8220;What&#8217;s the use?&#8221; says he. &#8220;They
told me at the hospital there wasn&#8217;t any help.
No, I&#8217;ll just stay here and plug it out by myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Talk about clear grit, eh! And maybe you
can frame up my feelin&#8217;s when he insists there
ain&#8217;t a thing I can do for him. About then, too,
I hears &#8217;em shoutin&#8217; from the car for me to
come along, as they&#8217;re all ready to start again.
So all I does is swap grips with Beany, get off
some fool speech about wishin&#8217; him luck, and
leave him standin&#8217; there in the potato field.</p>
<p>Somehow I didn&#8217;t enjoy the rest of that day&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
run very much, and when they jollies me by
askin&#8217; who&#8217;s my scarecrow acquaintance I
couldn&#8217;t work myself up to tellin&#8217; &#8217;em about
him. But all I could think of was Beany back
there pokin&#8217; around alone in the fog that was
settlin&#8217; down thicker and thicker every day.
And in the course of two or three hours I had a
thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pinckney,&#8221; says I, as we was puttin&#8217; up in
Newport, &#8220;you know all sorts of crackerjacks.
Got any expert eye doctors on your list?&#8221;</p>
<p>He chews that over a minute or so, and concludes
that he has, a Dr. Jason Craige, who&#8217;s
right here in town.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the real thing, is he?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most skillful oculist in the country,&#8221; says
Pinckney, &#8220;and charges accordingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As high as fifty a throw?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty!&#8221; says Pinckney. &#8220;You should see
his Cliff Walk cottage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s,&#8221; says I. &#8220;There&#8217;s a friend of mine
I&#8217;d like to have him take a look at to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No use,&#8221; says Pinckney. &#8220;He drops his
practice entirely during his vacation; wouldn&#8217;t
treat an Emperor then, I&#8217;ve heard him say.
He&#8217;s a good deal of a crank on that&mdash;and
billiards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But see here, Pinckney,&#8221; says I, and I goes
on to give him the whole tale about Beany,
puttin&#8217; it over as strong as I knew how.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; says Pinckney; &#8220;but I know of no
way in which I could induce him to change his
custom. He&#8217;s Scotch, you know, and as obstinate
as&mdash;&mdash; Hold on, Shorty! I&#8217;ve an idea.
How strong will you back my game of billiards?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now of all the erratic cue performers I ever
watched, Pinckney gets the medal. There&#8217;s
times when he can nurse &#8217;em along the cushion
and run up quite a string, and then again I&#8217;ve
seen him play a game any duffer&#8217;d be ashamed
of. But I begins to smell out his scheme.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it means a chance for Beany,&#8221; says I,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll bid good-by to five twenties and let you
do your worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A wager of that sort would tempt Craige,
if anything would,&#8221; says Pinckney. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
try it on, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether it was the bluff Pinckney threw, or
the insultin&#8217; way he suggests that the Doc don&#8217;t
dare take him up, I can&#8217;t say. All I know is
that inside of half an hour we was in Jason
Craige&#8217;s private billiard room, him and Pinckney
peeled down to their shirts, and at it.</p>
<p>As a rule I could go to sleep watchin&#8217; the best
three-ball carom game ever played; but durin&#8217;
this contest I holds the marker&#8217;s stick and never
misses a move. First off Pinckney plays about
as skillful as a trained pig practicin&#8217; on the
piano; but after four or five minutes of punk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
exhibition he takes a brace and surprises himself.</p>
<p>No need going into details. Pinckney wins
out, and the Doc slams his cue into the rack
with some remark about producin&#8217; the charity
patient to-morrow. Did I? I routs Renée out
at daylight next mornin&#8217;, has him make a fifty-mile
run at Vanderbilt Cup speed, and we has
Beany in the eye expert&#8217;s lib&#8217;ry before he comes
down for breakfast.</p>
<p>It takes Dr. Craige less&#8217;n three minutes to
discover that the hospital hand who told Beany
he was bound to lose both lamps was a fat
brained nut who&#8217;d be more useful drivin&#8217; an
ashcart. The Doc lays Beany out on a leather
couch, uses a little cocaine in the right place,
monkeys around a minute or so with some shiny
hardware, and announces that after he&#8217;s laid up
for twenty-four hours in a dark room, usin&#8217; the
wash reg&#8217;lar, he&#8217;ll be able to see as well as any
of us.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fact, too; for Beany goes back on his
old job next Monday mornin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; says Pinckney, after the trick
is turned. &#8220;A miracle, Craige!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miracle be blowed!&#8221; says the Doc. &#8220;You
accomplished the miracle last night, Pinckney,
when you ran thirty-two buttons on scratch
hits.&#8221;</p>
